"Make your children exercise, without them even knowing!",10 WAYS TO GET ACTIVE WITH YOUR KIDS,information2,putiancuarterocam19@gmail.com,"All children aged five or over should be physically active for at least one hour a day.

Physical activity helps children:
	•	grow strong muscles and bones
	•	maintain a healthy weight
	•	discover the world around them
	•	build their confidence
	
You can help by encouraging your child to find activities they enjoy and building physical activity into family life.


10 WAYS TO MAKE EXERCISE FUN

1. Walk, scooter, or cycle to and from school together as often as possible.
2. Build a den or treehouse with them in the school holidays. Or, under supervision, encourage them to climb a tree or two.
3. Go roller skating, rollerblading or skateboarding, indoors or outside. 
4. Do an activity challenge together, such as training for a fun run or charity walk. 
5. Take the dog for a walk. If you don't have one of your own, ask if you can borrow a friend or neighbor's dog.
6. Support your kids in sports, clubs or any other activities that may interest them. Joining a weekend club sport encourages them to make a commitment to a team and regular exercise. 
7. Find time every weekend to do something active with your children. Play frisbee or football in the park, go trampolining, or try indoor rock climbing.
8. Fly a kite. 
9. Take a trip to the beach. Beaches offer loads of ways for kids to get active, including games, rock-pooling, swimming, and plenty of running around. Or try an activity-based holiday. 
10. Go around some parks in your community.",2018-07-06T09:31:32.050Z

	•	build activity into your day
	•	search for activities or classes 
	•	browse activities and sports


BUILD ACTIVITY INTO YOUR DAY
To improve your health, try to put some time aside to do activities that improve your heart health and your muscle strength.

It is recommended doing at least 150 minutes of activity a week as well as strength exercises on two or more days a week.

But don't worry about hitting these targets straight away: every little helps. What's more important is choosing an activity you enjoy.

The easiest way to increase your activity levels is to build activity into the things you do every day, like going to work, shopping and seeing friends.


TIPS TO BUILD ACTIVITY INTO YOUR DAY
	•	Walk or ride part of your journey to work or the shops.
	•	Get off a bus or train stop before your destination.
	•	If you drive, park further away from your office and walk or ride the rest of the way.
	•	Go for a walk or a ride with your friend rather than meeting for coffee.
	•	Exercise before or after work, or during your lunch break.
	•	Lots of gardening can provide a good workout.
	•	Exercise in front of the TV.
	•	Try an online video workout.",2018-07-06T09:41:23.218Z

"From weekend warriors to elite athletes, stretching before exercise is a common practice, but new research has cast doubt on its effectiveness.",DO I NEED TO STRETCH BEFORE EXERCISING?,information2,putiancuarterocam19@gmail.com,"Research suggests that stretching before exercise is unlikely to reduce your risk of injury, improve your performance or prevent sore muscles.

However, there’s no evidence that stretching before or after exercise will do you any harm, either.

The upshot is if you enjoy stretching, or it is a staple in your exercise routine, there’s no reason to stop. Try this 5-minute post-exercise stretch routine.

Read on to get a deeper understanding of the mechanics of stretching and work out just how much stretching you really need in your life.


WHAT'S THE POINT OF STRETCHING?
Stretching for sport and exercise improves flexibility, which increases the ability of a joint to move through its full range of motion; in other words, how far it can bend, twist and reach. Some activities, such as gymnastics, require more flexibility than others, such as running.


DIFFERENT TYPES OF STRETCHES
Static stretch: stretching a muscle to the point of mild discomfort and holding that position, typically for at least 30 seconds or longer.
Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF): methods vary, but typically PNF involves holding a stretch while contracting and relaxing the muscle. 
Dynamic stretch: performing gentle repetitive movements, such as arm swings, where one gradually increases the range of motion of the movement, but always remains within the normal range of motion. 
Ballistic or bouncing stretches: involves going into a stretch and performing bouncing or jerking movements to increase range of motion.
Most of the research on stretching has focused on static stretching; there is less evidence on other forms.


WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE STRETCH?
While the exact mechanics of what happens are not fully understood, regular stretching is thought to increase flexibility, both by making muscles suppler and by retraining the nervous system to tolerate stretching further. Flexibility from regular stretching gradually disappears once you stop stretching – typically after four weeks.

Dr Polly McGuigan, a lecturer in biomechanics from the University of Bath, says it’s unclear whether the increase in range of motion of a joint is due to physical changes in the muscles that control those joints, or just a greater tolerance to stretch. She says: “My feeling is that there must be some changes at the muscle-tendon unit level, as just increasing tolerance would not have the scale of effect that can be seen with some stretching programs.”


HOW MUCH FLEXIBILITY DO I NEED?
It depends on your activity. The flexibility demands of a gymnast or a ballet dancer are clearly different to those of a runner. There is little to be gained for a jogger or runner from having the flexibility of a gymnast.

To generate power during exercise, the muscles and tendons store and release energy like a spring. Too much flexibility may reduce the muscle’s natural spring, which may be detrimental for activities involving running, jumping and sudden changes in direction, such as running, football or basketball.
 
“However, too little flexibility may increase the risk of muscle strain injury, as the muscles are unable to lengthen and absorb this energy,” says Dr Anthony Kay, Associate Professor of Biomechanics from the University of Northampton.


DOES STRETCHING BEFORE EXERCISE AFFECT PERFORMANCE?
Research suggests that stretching before exercise makes your muscles weaker and slower, even though you might feel looser. “For most performances, this would be detrimental,” says Dr Ian Shrier, a sports medicine clinician and researcher and Associate Professor at the Department of Family Medicine, at Montreal’s McGill University.

However, stretching also increases your range of motion. “A ballerina might require stretching before performance to do a full split during the show,” says Dr Shrier. “Even though she is weaker, her performance will be improved.” 

Dr Kay, who was the lead author on one of the largest reviews on pre-performance stretching, believes the reduction in performance from pre-exercise stretching has been overstated. “It is likely that durations of stretch used in the warm-up routines of most recreational exercisers produce negligible and transient reductions in strength,” he says. 


DOES STRETCHING BEFORE EXERCISSE REDUCE THE RISK OF INJURY?
The evidence strongly suggests that pre-exercise stretching does not reduce the risk of injury. Professor Rob Herbert, Senior Principal Researcher Fellow with Neuroscience Research Australia, took part in the three largest randomized trials on the effects of stretching. They all concluded that stretching had little or no beneficial effect on reduction in injury risk.

The most recent and largest of the three studies found “a hint” of an effect on reducing injuries like ligament tears, muscle tears, strains and sprains. But Prof Herbert cautioned, “If stretching does cut your odds of one of these types of injuries, it’s by only a very small amount.”


WHEN DO INJURIES OCCUR?
Muscle injuries happen when the muscle is put under too much stress, typically when it is stretched under pressure – for instance, when lowering a heavy weight.

The injury occurs not because the muscle isn’t flexible enough, but because the muscle isn’t producing enough force to support itself. A muscle might not produce enough force, either because it is not strong enough or it didn’t contract at the right time for a particular movement.


DOES STRETCHING REDUCE SORENESS?
There is no evidence that stretching helps to reduce or prevent a type of pain that can show up a day or two after exercising – also called delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS).

A 2011 review by Prof Herbert found that “muscle stretching, whether conducted before, after, or before and after exercise, does not produce clinically important reductions in delayed onset muscle soreness in healthy adults.”


SHOULD I STRETCH BEFORE EXERCISING?
Your decision to stretch or not to stretch should be based on what you want to achieve. “If the objective is to reduce injury, stretching before exercise is not helpful,” says Dr Shrier. Your time would be better spent by warming up your muscles with light aerobic movements and gradually increasing their intensity.

“If your objective is to increase your range of motion so that you can more easily do the splits, and this is more beneficial than the small loss in force, then you should stretch,” says Dr Shrier.

For most recreational exercisers, stretching before exercise is therefore a matter of personal preference. “If you like stretching, do it, and if you don’t like stretching, don’t do it,” says Prof Herbert.


HOW SHOULD I WARM UP?
The purpose of warming up is to prepare mentally and physically for your chosen activity. A typical warm up will take at least 10 minutes and involve light aerobic movements and some dynamic stretching that mimics the movements of the activity you’re about to perform.

“Gradually increasing the range of motion of these movements during the warm up will prepare the body for more intense versions of those movements during the sport itself,” says Dr McGuigan. This process will raise your heart rate and increase the blood flow to your muscles, thereby warming them up.

Warm muscles are less stiff and work more efficiently. Increased blood flow enables more oxygen to reach the muscles and produce energy. The warm up also activates the nerve signals to your muscles, which results in faster reaction times.  


SHOULD I STRETCH AFTER EXERCISING?
There is some evidence that regular static stretching outside periods of exercise may increase power and speed, and reduce injury. The best time to stretch is when the muscles are warm and pliable. This could be during a yoga or pilates class, or just after exercising.

However, there is very limited evidence about specifically stretching after exercise. Dr Shier says: “Since people tend not to set aside one time to stretch and one time for other activities, I recommend that they stretch after exercise.”

A post-exercise stretch will also slow down your breathing and heart rate, and bring the mind and body back to a resting state.",2018-07-06T11:27:36.081Z
"We all know we need to be more active, but there is increasing evidence that we also need to spend less time sitting down.",WHY WE SHOULD SIT LESS,information2,putiancuarterocam19@gmail.com,"To reduce our risk of ill health from inactivity, we are advised to exercise regularly – at least 150 minutes a week – and reduce sitting time.

	•	children aged under 5 
	•	young people
	•	adults
	•	older adults


MOVE MORE, SIT LESS
The Start Active, Stay Active report (PDF, 1.34Mb) recommends breaking up long periods of sitting time with ""shorter bouts of activity for just one to two minutes"".
A panel of leading experts (PDF, 964kb), chaired by Professor Stuart Biddle, who reviewed the evidence on sitting for the report recommended taking ""an active break from sitting every 30 minutes"".

However, there is currently not enough evidence to set a time limit on how much time people should sit each day.

Nevertheless, some countries – such as Australia, the US and Finland – have made recommendations that children limit screen time, such as TV and video games, to just one to two hours a day.

Recent research has suggested that exercising at least 60 minutes a day can offset the negative effects of sitting too much throughout the day.  

AGE-SPECIFIC ADVICE
The recommendations to reduce sitting time apply to all age groups.

UNDER-5s
In children under five, the advice is to limit the time they spend watching TV, travelling by car, bus or train.

""There is emerging evidence that sedentary behavior in the early years is associated with overweight and obesity, as well as lower cognitive development,"" says the Start Active, Stay Active report.

While this may be a challenge for busy parents, the advice reflects growing awareness that early life experiences and habits impact upon our health as adults.

""There is a need to establish healthy patterns of behavior during the early years in order to protect against possible health detriments in the future,"" says the report.

Tips to reduce sitting time
	•	Reduce time spent in infant carriers, car seats or highchairs.
	•	Reduce time spent in walking aids or baby bouncers.
	•	Reduce time spent in front of the TV or other screens.

Get more activity ideas for under 5s.


CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE
Research suggests that children and young people in households with multiple TVs and computers tend to sit more.

For children aged 5 to 18 years, reducing sitting time includes anything that involves moving in and around the home, classroom or community.

Tips to reduce sitting time
	•	Consider ways for children to ""earn"" screen time.
	•	Agree a family limit to screen time per day.
	•	Make bedrooms a TV- and computer-free zone.
	•	Set ""no screen time"" rules to encourage kids to be active.
	•	Encourage participation in house chores such as setting the table or taking the trash out.
	•	Choose gifts such as a scooter, skateboard, ball, or kite to encourage active play.

Parents could lead by example by also reducing their TV time and other sitting-based tasks.


ADULTS
Adults aged 19 to 64 are advised to try to sit down less throughout the day, including at work, when travelling, and at home.

Tips to reduce sitting time
	•	Stand on the train or bus.
	•	Take the stairs and walk up escalators.
	•	Set a reminder to get up every 30 minutes.
	•	Place a laptop on a box or similar to work standing.
	•	Stand or walk around while on the phone.
	•	Take a walk break every time you take a coffee or tea break.
	•	Walk to a co-worker's desk instead of emailing or calling.
	•	Swap some TV time for more active tasks or hobbies.


OLDER ADULTS
Some older adults (aged 65 and over) are known to spend 10 hours or more each day sitting or lying down, making them the most sedentary population group.

""It could be partly due to reduced functionality or ill health, but there are also social norms expecting those in later years to 'slow down' and rest,"" says Professor Biddle. ""That's not helpful.""

Older adults should aim to minimize the time they spend in extended periods of sitting each day.

""Sitting needs breaking up,"" says Professor Biddle. ""Long periods of TV should be avoided, and you should try to do activities that involve light movement and being 'on your feet' as much as possible.

""Do some tasks standing, like having coffee and chats, or even writing a letter – Ernest Hemingway wrote his novels standing.""

Tips to reduce sitting time
	•	Avoid long periods sat in front of a TV or computer.
	•	Stand up and move during TV advert breaks.
	•	Stand or walk while on the phone.
	•	Use the stairs as much as possible.
	•	Take up active hobbies such as gardening and DIY.
	•	Join in community-based activities, such as dance classes and walking groups.
	•	Take up active play with the grandchildren.
	•	Do most types of housework.",2018-07-06T12:04:38.949Z

	•	adults (19 to 64 years old)
	•	older adults (65 and over)

Exercise is the miracle cure we’ve always had, but for too long we’ve neglected to take our recommended dose. Our health is now suffering as a consequence.
This is no snake oil. Whatever your age, there's strong scientific evidence that being physically active can help you lead a healthier and even happier life.
People who do regular activity have a lower risk of many chronic diseases, such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes, stroke, and some cancers.

Research shows that physical activity can also boost self-esteem, mood, sleep quality and energy, as well as reducing your risk of stress, depression, dementia and Alzheimer’s disease.

“If exercise were a pill, it would be one of the most cost-effective drugs ever invented,” says Dr Nick Cavill, a health promotion consultant.


HEALTH BENEFITS
Given the overwhelming evidence, it seems obvious that we should all be physically active. It's essential if you want to live a healthy and fulfilling life into old age.

It's medically proven that people who do regular physical activity have:
	•	up to a 35% lower risk of coronary heart disease and stroke
	•	up to a 50% lower risk of type 2 diabetes
	•	up to a 50% lower risk of colon cancer
	•	up to a 20% lower risk of breast cancer
	•	a 30% lower risk of early death
	•	up to an 83% lower risk of osteoarthritis
	•	up to a 68% lower risk of hip fracture
	•	a 30% lower risk of falls (among older adults)
	•	up to a 30% lower risk of depression
	•	up to a 30% lower risk of dementia


WHAT COUNTS?
To stay healthy, adults should try to be active daily and aim to achieve at least 150 minutes of physical activity over a week through a variety of activities.
For most people, the easiest way to get moving is to make activity part of everyday life, like walking or cycling instead of using the car to get around. However, the more you do, the better, and taking part in activities such as sports and exercise will make you even healthier.

For any type of activity to benefit your health, you need to be moving quick enough to raise your heart rate, breathe faster and feel warmer. This level of effort is called moderate intensity activity. One way to tell if you're working at a moderate intensity is if you can still talk but you can't sing the words to a song.
If your activity requires you to work even harder, it is called vigorous intensity activity. There is substantial evidence that vigorous activity can bring health benefits over and above that of moderate activity. You can tell when it’s vigorous activity because you're breathing hard and fast, and your heart rate has gone up quite a bit. If you're working at this level, you won't be able to say more than a few words without pausing for a breath.


A MODERN PROBLEM
People are less active nowadays, partly because technology has made our lives easier. We drive cars or take public transport. Machines wash our clothes. We entertain ourselves in front of a TV or computer screen. Fewer people are doing manual work, and most of us have jobs that involve little physical effort. Work, house chores, shopping and other necessary activities are far less demanding than for previous generations.
We move around less and burn off less energy than people used to. Research suggests that many adults spend more than seven hours a day sitting down, at work, on transport or in their leisure time. People aged over 65 spend 10 hours or more each day sitting or lying down, making them the most sedentary age group. 


SEDENTARY LIFESTYLES
Inactivity is described by the Department of Health as a “silent killer”. Evidence is emerging that sedentary behavior, such as sitting or lying down for long periods, is bad for your health.

Not only should you try to raise your activity levels, but you should also reduce the amount of time you and your family spend sitting down.

Common examples of sedentary behavior include watching TV, using a computer, using the car for short journeys and sitting down to read, talk or listen to music – and such behavior is thought to increase your risk of many chronic diseases, such as heart disease, stroke and type 2 diabetes, as well as weight gain and obesity. 

“Previous generations were active more naturally through work and manual labor, but today we have to find ways of integrating activity into our daily lives,” says Dr Cavill.

Whether it's limiting the time babies spend strapped in their buggies, or encouraging adults to stand up and move frequently, people of all ages need to reduce their sedentary behavior.

“This means that each of us needs to think about increasing the types of activities that suit our lifestyle and can easily be included in our day,” says Dr Cavill.

Crucially, you can hit your weekly activity target but still be at risk of ill health if you spend the rest of the time sitting or lying down. For tips on building physical activity and exercise into your day, whatever your age, read Get active your way.",2018-07-06T12:10:21.352Z
How much physical activity do adults aged 19-64 years old need to do to stay healthy?,PHYSICAL ACTIVITY GUIDELINES FOR ADULTS,information2,putiancuarterocam19@gmail.com,"To stay healthy or improve health, adults need to do two types of physical activity each week: aerobic and strength exercises.

How much physical activity you need to do each week depends on your age. Click on the links below for the recommendations for other age groups:
	•	Early childhood (under 5 years old)
	•	Young people (5 to 18 years old)
	•	Older adults (65 and over)  

GUIDELINES FOR ADULTS AGED 19-64
To stay healthy, adults aged 19-64 should try to be active daily and should do:
	•	At least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity such as cycling or brisk walking every week, and  
	•	Strength exercises on two or more days a week that work all the major muscles (legs, hips, back, abdomen, chest, shoulders, and arms)  
	•	75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity, such as running or a game of singles tennis every week, and
	•	Strength exercises on two or more days a week that work all the major muscles (legs, hips, back, abdomen, chest, shoulders, and arms) 
	•	A mix of moderate and vigorous aerobic activity every week. For example, two 30-minute runs plus 30 minutes of brisk walking equates to 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity, and
	•	Strength exercises on two or more days a week that work all the major muscles (legs, hips, back, abdomen, chest, shoulders, and arms)  

A good rule is that one minute of vigorous activity provides the same health benefits as two minutes of moderate activity.

One way to do your recommended 150 minutes of weekly physical activity is to do 30 minutes on five days every week.

All adults should also break up long periods of sitting with light activity. Find out why sitting is bad for your health.

WHAT COUNTS AS MODERATE AEROBIC ACTIVITY?
Examples of activities that require moderate effort for most people include:
	•	brisk walking 
	•	water aerobics
	•	riding a bike on level ground or with few hills
	•	doubles tennis
	•	pushing a lawn mower
	•	hiking
	•	skateboarding
	•	rollerblading

	•	Choose a gym suited for you.
	•	Swimming can feel quite liberating if you have a physical disability, as your body is mostly supported by the water. Many pools offer classes and sessions catering specifically for disabled people. 
	•	Adapted sports – many sports can be played by disabled people on the same basis as non-disabled people. Some, such as blind football, have also been adapted to make them more disability-friendly. ",2018-07-06T13:31:17.236Z
Find out what food and drink will help you get the most out of your sport and fitness activities.,FOOD AND DRINKS FOR SPORT,information2,putiancuarterocam19@gmail.com,"You should aim to eat a healthy, balanced diet whatever your activity level, as this will provide you with all the nutrients you need.
The Eatwell Guide shows you how much you should eat from each food group to get the balance right.

This page covers:
	•	food for energy
	•	food for muscles
	•	food to avoid before exercise
	•	food before exercise
	•	food and drink during exercise
	•	water during exercise
	•	what to eat after exercise
	•	food supplements and exercise
	•	exercise to lose weight


FOOD FOR ENERGY
Starchy and other forms of carbohydrate provide a source of energy for your body to perform at its best, no matter what your sport or activity.

In general, the more you exercise, the more carbohydrate you need to include in your daily meals and around exercise. 

A demanding exercise regime will use up your stored energy from carbohydrate 
quickly, so include some carbohydrate in most of your meals.

A diet low in carbohydrate can lead to a lack of energy during exercise, loss of concentration, and delayed recovery.

If you wish to adopt a lower carbohydrate diet for your sport, you should seek specialist advice.

Healthy sources of carbohydrate include:
	•	wholegrain bread
	•	wholegrain breakfast cereals (including some cereal bars)
	•	brown rice
	•	wholewheat pasta 
	•	potatoes (with skins on) 
	•	fruit, including dried and tinned fruit


FOOD FOR MUSCLES
Eating protein-rich foods alone won't build big muscles.

Muscle is gained through a combination of muscle-strengthening exercise, and a diet that contains protein and sufficient energy from a balance of carbohydrates and fats.

Not all the protein you eat is used to build new muscle. If you overeat protein, the excess will be used mostly for energy once your body has what it needs for muscle repair.

Most fitness enthusiasts can get enough protein from a healthy, varied diet without having to increase their protein intake significantly. 

Healthy sources of protein:
	•	beans, peas and lentils 
	•	cheese, yoghurt and milk 
	•	fish, including oily fish like salmon or mackerel
	•	eggs
	•	tofu, tempeh and other plant-based meat-alternatives 
	•	lean cuts of meat and mince
	•	chicken and other poultry
A source of protein should be included at most mealtimes to optimize muscle building.

Taking in protein before and after a workout has been shown to help kickstart the muscle repair process.
Training protein snacks:
	•	milk of all types – but lower-fat types contain less energy
	•	unsweetened soy drink 
	•	natural dairy yoghurt of all types – including Greek yoghurt and kefir
	•	soy yoghurt and other plant-based alternatives
	•	unsalted mixed nuts and seeds 
	•	unsweetened dried fruit 
	•	boiled eggs 
	•	hummus with carrot and celery stick


FOOD BEFORE SPORT AND EXERCISE
You should allow about three hours before you exercise after having a main meal, such as breakfast or lunch.

An hour before exercising, having a light snack that contains some protein, and is higher in carbohydrate and lower in fat, is a good choice to help you perform during your training and recover afterwards.

Choose a snack that you'll digest quickly, like:
	•	porridge 
	•	fruit, such as a banana  
	•	a slice of wholegrain bread spread thinly with a nut butter
	•	a plain or fruit scone with low-fat cheese
	•	yoghurt or non-dairy alternatives 
	•	cottage cheese and crackers
	•	a glass of milk or non-dairy alternatives


SNACKS TO AVOID BEFORE EXERCISE
These types of food may cause stomach discomfort if eaten just before exercising.

Fatty foods, like:
	•	chips or french fries
	•	avocados
	•	olives
	•	crisps
	•	full-fat cheeses 
	•	large amounts of nuts

High-fibre foods, like:
	•	raw vegetables
	•	high-fibre cereals
	•	raw nuts and seeds


FOOD AND DRINK DURING EXERCISE
Most exercise lasting less than 60 minutes only requires water.

If you're exercising for longer, have a quick-digesting carbohydrate and some electrolytes (salts and minerals), such as:
	•	an isotonic sports drink
	•	a glass of milk 
	•	a banana
	•	dried fruit
	•	a cereal or sports bar
	•	carbohydrate gel

Make sure you're drinking enough water (or similar) during your effort. 


WATER AND EXERCISE
Not drinking enough water can have a major effect on your performance.

You should start any exercise session well hydrated. This means drinking water regularly throughout the day.

The choice of drink depends on the intensity and duration of the exercise, and your training goals.

In general:
	•	only water is needed for moderate exercise that lasts less than an hour
	•	an isotonic sports drink, milk, or a combination of high-carbohydrate food and water for hard sessions that last longer than an hour
You can make a homemade sports drink with 200ml of squash (not low calorie), 800ml water and a large pinch of salt.


WHAT TO EAT AFTER EXERCISE
Food and drink also plays a part in recovering effectively from training.

If you train several times a day, refuelling with a source of carbohydrate and protein – such as a glass of milk and a banana – within 60 minutes of finishing your first session can help you recover faster.

If you're training less than this or have more time to recover, make sure you rehydrate with water and eat as soon as you can afterwards. This might be your next main meal.


FOOD SUPPLEMENTS AND EXERCISE
In general, a balanced diet will provide the nutrients and energy necessary for sport without the need for food supplements.


EXERCISE TO LOSE WEIGHT
A demanding exercise routine can leave you feeling quite hungry if you're not refuelling correctly in between exercise sessions.

If you're trying to lose weight, you'll need to watch what you eat and drink after your workouts.

If you consume more energy than you burned during your exercise, you may find yourself putting on weight rather than losing it.

A punishing exercise routine may not be the best way to lose weight. ",2018-07-06T13:50:25.377Z
Everything you should know about chickenpox.,CHICKENPOX,information2,putiancuarterocam19@gmail.com,"Chickenpox is common and mostly affects children, although you can get it at any age. It usually gets better by itself within a week without needing to see a doctor.


CHECK IF IT'S CHICKENPOX
1. Chickenpox starts with red spots. They can appear anywhere on the body.
2. The spots fill with fluid. The blisters may burst. They might spread or stay in a small area.
3. The spots scab over. More blisters might appear while others scab over.


OTHER SYMPTOMS
You might get symptoms before or after the spots, including:
	•	a high temperature above 38C
	•	aches and pains, and generally not feeling well
	•	loss of appetite
Chickenpox is very itchy and can make children feel miserable, even if they don't have many spots. Chickenpox is usually much worse in adults.
It's possible to get chickenpox more than once, although it's unusual.


THINGS YOU CAN DO FOR YOURSELF
You'll need to stay away from school, nursery or work until all the spots have crusted over. This is usually 5 days after the spots first appeared.

DO
	•	drink plenty of fluid (try ice lollies if your child isn't drinking) to avoid dehydration		
	•	take paracetamol to help with pain and discomfort
	•	put socks on your child's hands at night to stop scratching
	•	cut your child's nails
	•	use cooling creams or gels from your pharmacy
	•	speak to your pharmacist about using antihistamine medicine to help itching
	•	bathe in cool water and pat the skin dry (don't rub)
	•	dress in loose clothes
	•	check with your airline if you're going on holiday – many airlines won't allow you to fly with chickenpox

DON'T
	•	use ibuprofen – it can make someone with chickenpox very ill
	•	give aspirin to children under 16
	•	be around pregnant women, newborn babies and people with a weakened immune system, as it can be dangerous for them

Speak to a doctor if:
	•	you're not sure it's chickenpox
	•	the skin around the blisters is red, hot or painful (signs of infection)
	•	your child is dehydrated
	•	you're concerned about your child or they get worse
Tell the receptionist you think it's chickenpox before going in. They may recommend a special appointment time if other patients are at risk.

Ask for an urgent doctor appointment if:
	•	you're an adult and have chickenpox
	•	you're pregnant and haven't had chickenpox before and you've been near someone with it
	•	you have a weakened immune system and you've been near someone with chickenpox
	•	you think your newborn baby has chickenpox
In these situations, your doctor can prescribe medicine to prevent complications. You need to take it within 24 hours of the spots coming out.


IT'S EASY TO CATCH CHICKENPOX
You can catch chickenpox by being in the same room as someone with it. It's also spread by touching clothes or bedding that has fluid from the blisters on it.
How long chickenpox is infectious for
Chickenpox is infectious from 2 days before the spots appear to until they've crusted over, usually 5 days after they first appeared.
How soon you get symptoms after coming into contact with chickenpox
It takes 1 to 3 weeks from the time you were exposed to chickenpox for the spots to start appearing.


CHICKENPOX IN PREGNANCY
It's rare to get chickenpox when you're pregnant and the chance of it causing complications is low.
If you do get chickenpox when you're pregnant, there's a small risk of your baby being very ill when it's born.
Speak to your doctor if you haven't had chickenpox and you've been near someone with it.


THE CHICKENPOX VACCINE
You can get the chickenpox vaccine on the NHS if there's a risk of harming someone with a weakened immune system.
For example, a child could be vaccinated if one of their parents was having chemotherapy.
You can pay for the vaccine at some private clinics or travel clinics.


SHINGLES AND CHICKENPOX
You can't catch shingles from someone with chickenpox. You can catch chickenpox from someone with shingles if you haven't had chickenpox before.
When you get chickenpox, the virus stays in your body. It can be triggered again if your immune system is low and cause shingles.
This can be because of stress, certain conditions, or treatments like chemotherapy.",2018-07-06T13:58:59.568Z
"Symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, and everything you need to know about Hepatitis A. ",HEPATITS A,information2,putiancuarterocam19@gmail.com,"OVERVIEW
Hepatitis A is a liver infection caused by a virus that's spread in the feces of an infected person.

Certain groups are at high risk. This includes travelers to parts of the world with poor levels of sanitation, men who have sex with men, and people who inject drugs.

Hepatitis A can be unpleasant, but it's not usually serious and most people make a full recovery within a couple of months.

Some people, particularly young children, may not have any symptoms. But hepatitis A can occasionally last for many months and, in rare cases, it can be life-threatening if it causes the liver to stop working properly (liver failure).

A hepatitis A vaccine is available for people at a high risk of infection.

HOW CAN YOU GET HEPATITIS A
Hepatitis A is most widespread in parts of the world where standards of sanitation and food hygiene are generally poor, such as parts of Africa, the Indian subcontinent, the Far East, the Middle East, and Central and South America.

You can get the infection from:
	•	eating food prepared by someone with the infection who hasn't washed their hands properly or washed them in water contaminated with sewage
	•	drinking contaminated water (including ice cubes)
	•	eating raw or undercooked shellfish from contaminated water
	•	close contact with someone who has hepatitis A
	•	less commonly, having sex with someone who has the infection (this is particularly a risk for men who have sex with men) or injecting drugs using contaminated equipment

Someone with hepatitis A is most infectious from around two weeks before their symptoms appear until about a week after the symptoms first develop.


SYMPTOMS
The symptoms of hepatitis A develop, on average, around  four weeks after becoming infected, although not everyone with the infection will experience them.

See your doctor if you think you could have been infected with the virus. A blood test will be needed to rule out more serious conditions that have similar symptoms.

Initial symptoms
The initial symptoms of hepatitis A can include:
	•	feeling tired and generally not feeling well
	•	joint and muscle pain
	•	a mild fever – usually no higher than 39C (102.2F)
	•	loss of appetite
	•	feeling or being sick
	•	pain in the upper-right part of your tummy
	•	a headache, sore throat and cough
	•	constipation or diarrhoea
	•	a raised, itchy rash (hives)
These symptoms usually last from a few days up to a couple of weeks.

Later symptoms
After the initial symptoms, the following symptoms may develop:
	•	yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice)
	•	dark urine
	•	pale stools
	•	itchy skin
	•	the upper-right part of your tummy becoming swollen and tender
Most people make a full recovery within a couple of months, although the symptoms can come and go for up to six months.

Signs of a serious problem
Hepatitis A isn't usually a serious illness, but in rare cases it can cause the liver to stop working properly (liver failure).

In addition to the symptoms above, signs of liver failure can include:
	•	sudden, severe vomiting
	•	a tendency to bruise and bleed easily (for example, frequent nosebleeds or bleeding gums)
	•	irritability
	•	problems with memory and concentration
	•	drowsiness and confusion
Get medical advice as soon as possible if you experience these symptoms. Liver failure can be life-threatening if not treated quickly.


CAUSES
Hepatitis A is caused by the hepatitis A virus, which is spread in the feces of someone with the infection.

Most infections occur in parts of the world where standards of sanitation and food hygiene are generally poor.


HOW HEPATITIS A IS SPREAD
You can get hepatitis A from:
	•	eating food prepared by someone with the infection who hasn't washed their hands properly, or washed them in water contaminated with sewage
	•	drinking contaminated water (including ice cubes)
	•	eating raw or undercooked shellfish from contaminated water
	•	close contact with someone who has hepatitis A
	•	having sex with someone who has the infection – particularly if you touch their rectum (back passage) with your fingers, mouth or tongue
	•	injecting drugs using equipment contaminated with the hepatitis A virus
Someone with hepatitis A is most infectious from around two weeks before they start to develop symptoms until about a week afterwards.


AT-RISK DESTINATIONS
Hepatitis A is found worldwide, but areas where it's most widespread include:
	•	sub-Saharan and northern Africa
	•	the Indian subcontinent (particularly India, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Nepal)
	•	some parts of the Far East (excluding Japan)
	•	the Middle East
	•	South and Central America
For information about the potential health risks in a specific country, check the country information on the Travel Health Pro website.


PEOPLE AT RISK OF HEPATITIS A
Certain groups are at an increased risk.

These include:
	•	close contacts of someone with hepatitis A
	•	men who have sex with other men
	•	people who inject illegal drugs
	•	people who may be exposed to hepatitis A through their job – this includes sewage workers, staff of institutions where levels of personal hygiene may be poor (such as a homeless shelter) and people working with monkeys, apes and gorillas (these animals may be infected with hepatitis A)
People in these groups are usually advised to have the hepatitis A vaccine to minimize their risk of infection.

WHEN TO GET MEDICAL ADVICE
See your doctor for advice if:
	•	you have symptoms of hepatitis A – a blood test can usually confirm whether you have the infection
	•	you might have been exposed to the hepatitis A virus recently but you don't have any symptoms – treatment given early on may be able to stop the infection developing
	•	you think you might need the hepatitis A vaccine – your doctor can advise you about whether you should have the vaccine (see below)
Although hepatitis A isn't usually serious, it's important to get a proper diagnosis to rule out more serious conditions with similar symptoms, such as hepatitis C or cirrhosis (scarring of the liver).
It may also be necessary to test your friends, family and any sexual partners, in case you've spread the infection to them.


TREATMENT
There's currently no cure for hepatitis A, but it will normally pass on its own within a couple of months. You can usually look after yourself at home.

However, it's still a good idea to see your doctor for a blood test if you think you could have hepatitis A, as more serious conditions can have similar symptoms.

Your doctor can also advise you about treatments and they may carry out regular blood tests to check how well your liver is working.

Go back to your doctor if your symptoms get worse or haven't started to improve within a couple of months.

Relieving your symptoms
The following advice may help:
	•	Get plenty of rest, especially during the initial stages of the infection, as you will probably feel very tired.
	•	Take painkillers such as paracetamol or ibuprofen if you have any aches and pains – how much you can take depends on how well your liver is working; ask your doctor for advice.
	•	Reduce itching by maintaining a cool, well-ventilated environment, wearing loose clothing and avoiding hot baths or showers – your doctor may recommend using an antihistamine in severe cases.
	•	Eat smaller, lighter meals to help reduce nausea and vomiting – your doctor can prescribe a medication called an antiemetic if the problem persists.
	•	Avoid alcohol – drinking alcohol can put additional strain on your liver, so avoid it until your doctor says it's safe.


PREVENTING THE SPREAD OF THE INFECTION
While you're ill, it's also important to try to reduce the risk of spreading the infection to others.

You should:
	•	Stay off work or school until at least a week after your jaundice or other symptoms started.
	•	Avoid preparing food for others if possible.
	•	Wash your hands with soap and water regularly – particularly after going to the toilet and before preparing food.
	•	Avoid sharing towels and wash soiled laundry separately on a hot cycle .
	•	Clean the toilet, flush handles and taps more frequently than usual .
	•	Avoid having sex while you're infectious – hepatitis A is most infectious from around two weeks before the symptoms start until about a week after they first develop. Ask your doctor for advice about this.

Any close contacts, such as people who live in the same house as you, may be advised to have the hepatitis A vaccine to reduce their risk of becoming infected.


VACCINATION
Vaccination against hepatitis A is only recommended for people at high risk.

Who should have the hepatitis A vaccine
People usually advised to have the hepatitis A vaccine include:
	•	close contacts of someone with hepatitis A
	•	people planning to travel to or live in parts of the world where hepatitis A is widespread, particularly if levels of sanitation and food hygiene are expected to be poor
	•	people with any type of long-term (chronic) liver disease
	•	men who have sex with other men
	•	people who inject illegal drugs
	•	people who may be exposed to hepatitis A through their job – this includes sewage workers, staff of institutions where levels of personal hygiene may be poor (such as a homeless shelter) and people working with monkeys, apes and gorillas

Contact your surgeon if you think you should have the hepatitis A vaccine or you're not sure whether you need it.


TYPES OF HEPATITIS VACCINE
There are three main types of hepatitis A vaccination:
	•	a vaccine for hepatitis A only
	•	a combined vaccine for hepatitis A and hepatitis B
	•	a combined vaccine for hepatitis A and typhoid fever
Talk to your doctor about which vaccine is most suitable for you. All three types are usually available for free on the NHS.

If you've traveling abroad, try to plan your vaccinations in advance. They should ideally be started at least two or three weeks before you leave, although some can be given up to the day of your departure if necessary.

Extra doses of the vaccine are often recommended after 6-12 months if you need long-term protection.


SIDE EFFECTS OF HEPATITIS A VACCINE
Some people develop temporary soreness, redness and hardening of the skin at the injection site after having the hepatitis A vaccine.

A small, painless lump may also form, but this usually disappears quickly and isn't a cause for concern.

Less common side effects include:
	•	a slightly raised temperature
	•	not feeling well
	•	tiredness
	•	headache
	•	feeling sick
	•	loss of appetite


OUTLOOK FOR HEPATITIS A
For most people, hepatitis A will pass within two months and there will be no long-term effects. Once it passes, you normally develop life-long immunity against the virus.

For around 1 in every 7 people with the infection, the symptoms may come and go for up to 6 months before eventually passing.

Life-threatening complications such as liver failure are rare, affecting less than 1 in every 250 people with hepatitis A. People most at risk include those with pre-existing liver problems and elderly people.
If liver failure does occur, a liver transplant is usually needed to treat it.",2018-07-06T14:54:39.331Z
"Symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, and everything you need to know about asthma. ",ASTHMA,information2,putiancuarterocam19@gmail.com,"OVERVIEW
Asthma is a common lung condition that causes occasional breathing difficulties.
It affects people of all ages and often starts in childhood, although it can also develop for the first time in adults.
There's currently no cure, but there are simple treatments that can help keep the symptoms under control so it doesn't have a big impact on your life.


SYMPTOMS
Most children and adults with asthma have times when their breathing becomes more difficult.
Some people with severe asthma may have breathing problems most of the time.
The most common symptoms of asthma are:
	•	wheezing (a whistling sound when breathing)
	•	breathlessness
	•	a tight chest – it may feel like a band is tightening around it 
	•	coughing
Many things can cause these symptoms, but they're more likely to be asthma if they:
	•	happen often and keep coming back
	•	are worse at night and early in the morning
	•	seem to happen in response to an asthma trigger like exercise or an allergy (such as to pollen or animal fur)
See a doctor if you think you or your child may have asthma, or you have asthma and are finding it hard to control.

ASTHMA ATTACKS
Asthma can sometimes get worse for a short time – this is known as an asthma attack. It can happen suddenly, or gradually over a few days.
Signs of a severe asthma attack include:
	•	wheezing, coughing and chest tightness becoming severe and constant
	•	being too breathless to eat, speak or sleep
	•	breathing faster
	•	a fast heartbeat
	•	drowsiness, confusion, exhaustion or dizziness
	•	blue lips or fingers
	•	fainting


CAUSES
The exact cause of asthma is unknown.
People with asthma have swollen (inflamed) and ""sensitive"" airways that become narrow and clogged with sticky mucus in response to certain triggers.
Genetics, pollution and modern hygiene standards have been suggested as causes, but there's not currently enough evidence to know if any of these do cause asthma.


WHO'S AT RISK?
A number of things can increase your chances of getting asthma. These include:
	•	having an allergy-related condition, such as eczema, a food allergy or hay fever – these are known as atopic conditions
	•	having a family history of asthma or atopic conditions
	•	having had bronchiolitis – a common childhood lung infection
	•	exposure to tobacco smoke as a child
	•	your mother smoking during pregnancy 
	•	being born prematurely (before 37 weeks) or with a low birthweight
Some people may also be at risk of developing asthma through their job.


ASTHMA TRIGGERS
Asthma symptoms often occur in response to a trigger. Common triggers include:
	•	infections like colds and flu
	•	allergies – such as to pollen, dust mites, animal fur or feathers
	•	smoke, fumes and pollution
	•	medicines – particularly anti-inflammatory painkillers like ibuprofen and aspirin
	•	emotions, including stress, or laughter
	•	weather – such as sudden changes in temperature, cold air, wind, thunderstorms, heat and humidity
	•	mould or damp
	•	exercise
Once you know your triggers, trying to avoid them may help control your asthma symptoms.


WORK-RELATED ASTHMA
In some cases, asthma is associated with substances you may be exposed to at work. This is known as occupational asthma.
Some of the most common causes of occupational asthma include:
	•	isocyanates (chemicals often found in spray paint)
	•	flour and grain dust
	•	colophony (a substance often found in solder fumes)
	•	latex
	•	animals
	•	wood dust
Paint sprayers, bakers, pastry makers, nurses, chemical workers, animal handlers, timber workers, welders and food processing workers are all examples of people who may have a higher risk of being exposed to these substances.


DIAGNOSIS
Asthma can usually be diagnosed from your symptoms and some simple tests.
Your doctor will probably be able to diagnose it, but they may refer you to a specialist if they're not sure.


SEEING YOUR DOCTOR
Your doctor may ask:
	•	what symptoms you have
	•	when they happen and how often
	•	if anything seems to trigger them
	•	if you have conditions such as eczema or allergies, or a family history of them
They may suggest doing some tests to confirm if you have asthma.
These can't always be done easily in young children, so your child may be given an asthma inhaler to see if it helps relieve their symptoms until they're old enough to have the tests.


TESTS FOR ASTHMA
The main tests used to help diagnose asthma are:
	•	FeNO test – you breathe into a machine that measures the level of nitric oxide in your breath, which is a sign of inflammation in your lungs
	•	spirometry – you blow into a machine that measures how fast you can breathe out and how much air you can hold in your lungs
	•	peak flow test – you blow into a handheld device that measures how fast you can breathe out, and this may be done several times over a few weeks to see if it changes over time
After you're diagnosed with asthma, you may also have allergy tests to see if your symptoms might be triggered by an allergy.


TREATMENT
There's currently no cure for asthma, but treatment can help control the symptoms so you're able to live a normal, active life.
Inhalers – devices that let you breathe in medicine – are the main treatment. Tablets and other treatments may also be needed if your asthma is severe.
You'll usually create a personal action plan with your doctor or asthma nurse. This includes information about your medicines, how to monitor your condition and what to do if you have an asthma attack.

INHALERS
Inhalers can help:
	•	relieve symptoms when they occur (reliever inhalers)
	•	stop symptoms developing (preventer inhalers)
Some people need an inhaler that does both (combination inhalers).

Reliever inhalers
Most people with asthma will be given a reliever inhaler. These are usually blue.
You use a reliever inhaler to treat your symptoms when they occur. They should relieve your symptoms within a few minutes.
Tell your doctor or asthma nurse if you have to use your reliever inhaler 3 or more times a week. They may suggest additional treatment, such as a preventer inhaler.
Reliever inhalers have few side effects, but they can sometimes cause shaking or a fast heartbeat for a few minutes after they're used.

Preventer inhalers
If you need to use a reliever inhaler often, you may also need a preventer inhaler.
You use a preventer inhaler every day to reduce the inflammation and sensitivity of your airways, which stops your symptoms occurring. It's important to use it even when you don't have symptoms.
Speak to your doctor or asthma nurse if you continue to have symptoms while using a preventer inhaler.
Preventer inhalers contain steroid medicine. They don't usually have side effects but can sometimes cause:
	•	a fungal infection of the mouth or throat (oral thrush)
	•	a hoarse voice
	•	a sore throat
You can help prevent these side effects by using a spacer– a hollow plastic tube you attach to your inhaler – as well as by rinsing your mouth or cleaning your teeth after using your inhaler.

Combination inhalers
If using reliever and preventer inhalers doesn't control your asthma, you may need an inhaler that combines both.
Combination inhalers are used every day to help stop symptoms occurring and provide long-lasting relief if they do occur.
It's important to use it regularly, even if you don't have symptoms.
Side effects of combination inhalers are similar to those of reliever and preventer inhalers.

Tablets
You may also need to take tablets if using an inhaler alone isn't helping control your symptoms.
Leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs)
LTRAs are the main tablets used for asthma. They also come in syrup and powder form.
You take them every day to help stop your symptoms occurring.
Possible side effects include tummy aches and headaches.

Theophylline
Theophylline may also be recommended if other treatments aren't helping to control your symptoms.
It's taken every day to stop your symptoms occurring.
Possible side effects include headaches and feeling sick.

Steroid tablets
Steroid tablets may be recommended if other treatments aren't helping to control your symptoms.
They can be taken either:
	•	as an immediate treatment when you have an asthma attack
	•	every day as a long-term treatment to prevent symptoms – this is usually only necessary if you have very severe asthma and inhalers don't control your symptoms
Long-term or frequent use of steroid tablets can occasionally cause side effects such as:
	•	increased appetite, leading to weight gain
	•	easy bruising
	•	mood changes
	•	fragile bones (osteoporosis)
	•	high blood pressure
You'll be monitored regularly while taking steroid tablets to check for signs of any problems.

OTHER TREATMENTS
Other treatments, such as injections or surgery, are rarely needed but may be recommended if all other treatments aren't helping.
Injections
For some people with severe asthma, injections given every few weeks can help control the symptoms.
The main injections for asthma are:
	•	omalizumab (Xolair)
	•	mepolizumab (Nucala)
	•	reslizumab (Cinqaero)
These medicines aren't suitable for everyone with asthma and can only be prescribed by an asthma specialist.
The main side effect is discomfort where the injection is given.

SURGERY
A procedure called bronchial thermoplasty is very occasionally used as a treatment for severe asthma.
It involves passing a thin, flexible tube down your throat and into your lungs. Heat is then used on the muscles around the airways to help stop them narrowing and causing asthma symptoms.
There's some evidence to suggest this may reduce asthma attacks, but it's a relatively new treatment and the long-term effects aren't yet fully understood.

COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES
Several complementary therapies have been suggested as possible treatments for asthma, including:
	•	breathing exercises – such as techniques called the Papworth method and the Buteyko method
	•	traditional Chinese herbal medicine
	•	acupuncture
	•	ionisers – devices that use an electric current to charge molecules of air
	•	manual therapies – such as chiropractic
	•	homeopathy
	•	dietary supplements
There's little evidence to suggest many of these treatments help.
There's some evidence that breathing exercises can improve symptoms and reduce the need for reliever medicines in some people, but they shouldn't be used instead of your medicine.

Work-related Asthma
If you seem to have occupational asthma, where your asthma is linked to your job, you'll be referred to a specialist to confirm the diagnosis.
If your employer has an occupational health service, they should also be informed, along with your health and safety officer.
Your employer has a responsibility to protect you from the causes of occupational asthma. It may sometimes be possible to:
	•	substitute or remove the substance that's triggering your asthma from your workplace
	•	redeploy you to another role within the company
	•	provide you with protective breathing equipment


LIVING WITH ASTHMA
With treatment, most people with asthma can live normal lives. There are also some simple ways you can help keep your symptoms under control.

THINGS YOU CAN DO
	•	use your inhaler correctly – you can ask your nurse or doctor for advice if you're still not sure
	•	use your preventer inhaler or tablets every day – this can help keep your symptoms under control and prevent asthma attacks
	•	check before taking other medicines – always check the packet to see if a medicine is suitable for someone with asthma, and ask a pharmacist, doctor or nurse if you're not sure
	•	don't smoke – stopping smoking can significantly reduce how severe and frequent your symptoms are
	•	exercise regularly – exercise shouldn't trigger your symptoms once you're on appropriate treatment
	•	eat healthily – most people with asthma can have a normal diet
	•	get vaccinated – it's a good idea to have the annual flu jab and the one-off pneumococcal vaccination

IDENTIFY AND AVOID YOUR TRIGGERS
It's important to identify possible asthma triggers by making a note of where you are and what you're doing when your symptoms get worse.
Some triggers can be hard to avoid, but it may be possible to avoid some, such as dust mites, pet fur and some medicines. Speak to your doctor or asthma nurse for advice if you think you've identified a trigger for your symptoms.

REGULAR CHECK-UPS
You'll have regular contact with your doctor or asthma nurse to monitor your condition.
These appointments may involve:
	•	talking about your symptoms – for example, if they're affecting your normal activities or are getting worse
	•	a discussion about your medicines – including if you think you might be experiencing any side effects and if you need to be reminded how to use your inhaler
	•	breathing tests
It's also a good chance to ask any questions you have or raise any other issues you want to discuss.
You may be asked to help monitor your condition between appointments. For example, you may be advised to check your peak flow if you think your symptoms may be getting worse.
Your personal action plan should say what to do if your symptoms get gradually or suddenly worse. Contact your doctor or asthma nurse if you're not sure what to do.

COLD WEATHER AND ASTHMA
Cold weather is a common trigger for asthma symptoms. The following will help you control your symptoms in the cold:
	•	carry your reliever inhaler with you at all times and keep taking your regular preventer inhaler as prescribed
	•	if you need to use your inhaler more than usual, speak to your doctor about reviewing your treatment
	•	keep warm and dry – wear gloves, a scarf and a hat, and carry an umbrella
	•	wrap a scarf loosely over your nose and mouth – this will help warm up the air before you breathe it
	•	try breathing in through your nose instead of your mouth – your nose warms the air as you breathe


TRAVELLING WITH ASTHMA 
Asthma shouldn't stop you from traveling, but you'll need to take extra precautions when going on holidays and long trips.
Make sure you have enough medicine with you, and keep your reliever inhaler easily accessible.
If you've not seen your doctor or asthma nurse for a while, it's a good idea to see them before you travel to review your personal action plan and make sure it's up to date.
Your doctor or asthma nurse can also advise you about travelling with asthma.


PREGNANCY AND ASTHMA
Asthma doesn't affect your chances of having children, and the vast majority of women with asthma will have a normal pregnancy.
Generally, treatment stays the same during pregnancy. Most asthma medicines, particularly inhalers, are considered safe while pregnant or breastfeeding.
But you should speak to your doctor or asthma nurse for advice if you become pregnant or are planning a pregnancy, because:
	•	your symptoms may get worse during pregnancy – although some women find they improve – so your treatment may need to be reviewed regularly
	•	poorly controlled asthma in pregnancy can increase the risk of complications such as pre-eclampsia and premature birth
	•	extra precautions may need to be taken during labor to avoid an asthma attack, although attacks during labor are rare


ASTHMA AT SCHOOL
Most children with well-controlled asthma can learn and participate in school activities without being affected by their condition.
But it's important to ensure the school has up-to-date written information about your child's asthma medicines, including what they are, how much they take and when they need to take them.
You may also need to supply the school with a spare reliever inhaler for use if your child experiences symptoms during the school day.
Staff at the school should be able to recognize worsening asthma symptoms and know what to do in the event of an attack, particularly staff supervising sport or physical education.


TALKING TO OTHERS
Many people with long-term health conditions such as asthma experience feelings of stress, anxiety and depression.
You may find it helpful to talk about your experience of asthma with others. Patient organizations have local groups where you can meet people who have been diagnosed with asthma and have undergone treatment.
If you feel you're struggling to cope, talk to your doctor. They will be able to give advice and support.


ASTHMA ATTACK
Every 10 seconds someone has a potentially life-threatening asthma attack. If you're on the right asthma treatment, your chance of having an attack is greatly reduced. Visit your doctor or asthma nurse at least once a year for a check-up and to discuss your treatment.

Symptoms of an asthma attack
Signs that you may be having an asthma attack include:
	•	your symptoms are getting worse (cough, breathlessness, wheezing or tight chest)
	•	your reliever inhaler (usually blue) isn't helping
	•	you're too breathless to speak, eat or sleep
	•	your breathing is getting faster and it feels like you can't catch your breath
	•	your peak flow score is lower than normal
	•	children may also complain of a tummy or chest ache
The symptoms won't necessarily occur suddenly. In fact, they often come on slowly over a few hours or days.

What to do if you have an asthma attack
If you think you're having an asthma attack, you should:
	1.	Sit upright (don't lie down) and try to take slow, steady breaths. Try to remain calm, as panicking will make things worse.
	2.	Take 1 puff of your reliever inhaler (usually blue) every 30 to 60 seconds, up to a maximum of 10 puffs.
	3.	Call for an ambulance if you don't have your inhaler with you, you feel worse despite using your inhaler, you don't feel better after taking 10 puffs or you're worried at any point.
	4.	If the ambulance hasn't arrived within 15 minutes, repeat step 2.
Never be frightened of calling for help in an emergency.
Try to take the details of your medicines (or your personal asthma action plan) with you to hospital if possible.
If your symptoms improve and you don't need to call an ambulance, get an urgent same-day appointment to see your doctor or asthma nurse.

After an asthma attack
You should see your doctor or asthma nurse within 48 hours of leaving hospital, or ideally on the same day if you didn't need hospital treatment.
About 1 in 6 people treated in hospital for an asthma attack need hospital care again within 2 weeks, so it's important to discuss how you can reduce your risk of future attacks.
Talk to your doctor or nurse about any changes that may need to be made to manage your condition safely.
For example, the dose of your treatment may need to be adjusted or you may need to be shown how to use your inhaler correctly.


PREVENTING ASTHMA ATT
The following steps can help you reduce your risk of having an asthma attack:
	•	follow your personal asthma action plan and take all of your medicines as prescribed
	•	have regular asthma reviews with your doctor or asthma nurse – these should be done at least once a year
	•	check with your doctor or asthma nurse that you're using your inhaler correctly
	•	avoid things that trigger your symptoms whenever possible
Don't ignore your symptoms if they're getting worse or you need to use your reliever inhaler more often than usual.
Follow your action plan and make an urgent appointment to see your doctor or asthma nurse if your symptoms continue to get worse.

ADVICE FOR FRIENDS AND FAMILY
It's important that your friends and family know how to help in an emergency.
It can be useful to make copies of your personal asthma action plan and share it with others who may need to know what to do when you have an attack.
Alternatively, you could take a photo of your action plan on your phone, so you can show or send it to others easily.",2018-07-08T14:19:42.932Z
"Symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, and everything you need to know about breast cancer. ",BREAST CANCER,information2,putiancuarterocam19@gmail.com,"OVERVIEW
Most women diagnosed with breast cancer are over 50, but younger women can also get breast cancer.
About one in eight women are diagnosed with breast cancer during their lifetime. There's a good chance of recovery if it's detected in its early stages.
For this reason, it's vital that women check their breasts regularly for any changes and always get any changes examined by their doctor.
In rare cases, men can also be diagnosed with breast cancer.

SYMPTOMS OF BREAST CANCER
Breast cancer can have a number of symptoms, but the first noticeable symptom is usually a lump or area of thickened breast tissue.
Most breast lumps aren't cancerous, but it's always best to have them checked by your doctor.
You should also see your doctor if you notice any of the following:
	•	a change in the size or shape of one or both breasts
	•	discharge from either of your nipples, which may be streaked with blood
	•	a lump or swelling in either of your armpits
	•	dimpling on the skin of your breasts
	•	a rash on or around your nipple
	•	a change in the appearance of your nipple, such as becoming sunken into your breast
Breast pain isn't usually a symptom of breast cancer.

CAUSES OF BREAST CANCER
The exact causes of breast cancer aren't fully understood. However, there are certain factors known to increase the risk of breast cancer.
These include:
	•	age – the risk increases as you get older
	•	a family history of breast cancer
	•	a previous diagnosis of breast cancer
	•	a previous benign breast lump
	•	being tall, overweight or obese
	•	excessive use of alcohol


DIAGNOSING BREAST CANCER
After examining your breasts, your doctor may refer you to a specialist breast cancer clinic for further tests. This might include breast screening (mammography) or a biopsy.


TYPES OF BREAST CANCER
There are several different types of breast cancer, which can develop in different parts of the breast.
Breast cancer is often divided into:
	•	non-invasive breast cancer (carcinoma in situ) – found in the ducts of the breast (ductal carcinoma in situ, DCIS) and hasn't developed the ability to spread outside the breast. It's usually found during a mammogram and rarely shows as a breast lump.
	•	invasive breast cancer – usually develops in the cells that line the breast ducts (invasive ductal breast cancer) and is the most common type of breast cancer. It can spread outside the breast, although this doesn't necessarily mean it has spread.
Other less common types of breast cancer include:
	•	invasive (and pre-invasive) lobular breast cancer
	•	inflammatory breast cancer
	•	Paget's disease of the breast
It's possible for breast cancer to spread to other parts of the body, usually through the bloodstream or the axillary lymph nodes. These are small lymphatic glands that filter bacteria and cells from the mammary gland.
If this happens, it's known as secondary, or metastatic, breast cancer.

BREAST CANCER SCREENING
Mammographic screening, where X-ray images of the breast are taken, is the most commonly available method of detecting an early breast lesion.
However, you should be aware that a mammogram might fail to detect some breast cancers.
It might also increase your chances of having extra tests and interventions, including surgery, even if you're not affected by breast cancer.
Women with a higher-than-average risk of developing breast cancer may be offered screening and genetic testing for the condition.
As the risk of breast cancer increases with age, all women who are 50 to 70 years old are invited for breast cancer screening every three years.
Women over the age of 70 are also entitled to screening and can arrange an appointment through their doctor or local screening unit.

TREATING BREAST CANCER
If cancer is detected at an early stage, it can be treated before it spreads to nearby parts of the body.
Breast cancer is treated using a combination of:
	•	surgery
	•	chemotherapy
	•	radiotherapy
Surgery is usually the first type of treatment you'll have, followed by chemotherapy or radiotherapy or, in some cases, hormone or biological treatments.
The type of surgery and the treatment you have afterwards will depend on the type of breast cancer you have. Your doctor will discuss the best treatment plan with you.
In a small proportion of women, breast cancer is discovered after it's spread to other parts of the body (metastatic breast cancer).
Secondary cancer, also called advanced or metastatic cancer, isn't curable, so the aim of treatment is to achieve remission (symptom relief).

LIVING WITH BREAST CANCER
Being diagnosed with breast cancer can affect daily life in many ways, depending on what stage it's at and the treatment you're having.
How women cope with their diagnosis and treatment varies from person to person. You can be reassured that there are several forms of support available, if you need it.
For example:
	•	your family and friends can be a powerful support system
	•	you can communicate with other people in the same situation
	•	find out as much as possible about your condition
	•	don't try to do too much or overexert yourself
	•	make time for yourself


PREVENTING BREAST CANCER
As the causes of breast cancer aren't fully understood, at the moment it's not possible to know if it can be prevented.
If you're at increased risk of developing the condition, some treatments are available to reduce the risk.
Studies have looked at the link between breast cancer and diet. Although there are no definite conclusions, there are benefits for women who:
	•	maintain a healthy weight
	•	exercise regularly
	•	have a low intake of saturated fat and alcohol
It's been suggested that regular exercise can reduce your risk of breast cancer by as much as a third. Regular exercise and a healthy lifestyle can also improve the outlook for people affected by breast cancer. 
If you've been through the menopause, it's particularly important that you're not overweight or obese.
This is because being overweight or obese causes more oestrogen to be produced, which can increase the risk of breast cancer.

___________________________________________________________________________________________________________

SYMPTOMS
The first symptom of breast cancer most women notice is a lump or an area of thickened tissue in their breast.
Most breast lumps (90%) aren't cancerous, but it's always best to have them checked by your doctor.
You should see your doctor if you notice any of the following:
	•	a new lump or area of thickened tissue in either breast that was not there before
	•	a change in the size or shape of one or both breasts
	•	bloodstained discharge from either of your nipples 
	•	a lump or swelling in either of your armpits
	•	dimpling on the skin of your breasts
	•	a rash on or around your nipple
	•	a change in the appearance of your nipple, such as becoming sunken into your breast
Breast pain isn't usually a symptom of breast cancer.

BREAST AWARENESS
It's important to be breast aware so you can pick up any changes as soon as possible.
Get to know what is normal for you – for instance, your breasts may look or feel different at different times of your life. This will make it much easier to spot potential problems.

CAUSES
The causes of breast cancer aren't fully understood, making it difficult to say why one woman may develop breast cancer and another may not.
However, there are risk factors known to affect your likelihood of developing breast cancer. Some of these you can't do anything about, but there are some you can change.

AGE
The risk of developing breast cancer increases with age. The condition is most common among women over 50 who have been through the menopause. About 8 out of 10 cases of breast cancer occur in women over 50.
Family history
If you have close relatives who have had breast cancer or ovarian cancer, you may have a higher risk of developing breast cancer.
However, because breast cancer is the most common cancer in women, it's possible for it to occur in more than one family member by chance.
Most cases of breast cancer don't run in families, but particular genes known as BRCA1 and BRCA2 can increase your risk of developing both breast and ovarian cancer. It's possible for these genes to be passed on from a parent to their child. 
Other newly detected genes, such as TP53 and CHEK 2, are also associated with an increased risk of breast cancer.
If you have, for example, two or more close relatives from the same side of your family – such as your mother, sister or daughter – who have had breast cancer under the age of 50, you may be eligible for surveillance for breast cancer, or genetic screening to look for the genes that make developing breast cancer more likely.
If you're worried about your family history of breast cancer, discuss it with your doctor.

PREVIOUS CANCER OR BREAST LUMP
If you've previously had breast cancer or early non-invasive cancer cell changes in breast ducts, you have a higher risk of developing it again, either in your other breast or in the same breast.
A benign breast lump doesn't mean you have breast cancer, but certain types of lump may also slightly increase your risk of developing it.
Certain benign changes in your breast tissue, such as cells growing abnormally in ducts (atypical ductal hyperplasia), or abnormal cells inside your breast lobes (lobular carcinoma in situ), can make getting breast cancer more likely.

DENSE BREAST TISSUE
Your breasts are made up of thousands of tiny glands (lobules) that produce milk. This glandular tissue contains a higher concentration of breast cells than other breast tissue, making it denser.
Women with dense breast tissue may have a higher risk of developing breast cancer as there are more cells that can become cancerous.
Dense breast tissue can also make a breast scan (mammogram) difficult to read, as any lumps or areas of abnormal tissue are harder to spot.
Younger women tend to have denser breasts. As you get older, the amount of glandular tissue in your breasts decreases and is replaced by fat, so your breasts become less dense.

HORMONES AND HORMONE MEDICINE

Exposure to oestrogen
The female hormone oestrogen can sometimes stimulate breast cancer cells and cause them to grow.
The ovaries, where your eggs are stored, begin to produce oestrogen when you start puberty to regulate your periods.
Your risk of developing breast cancer may rise slightly with the amount of oestrogen your body is exposed to.
For example, if you started your periods at a young age and experienced the menopause at a late age, you'll have been exposed to oestrogen over a longer period of time.
In the same way, not having children or having children later in life may slightly increase your risk of developing breast cancer because your exposure to oestrogen is not interrupted by pregnancy.

Hormone replacement therapy (HRT)
Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is associated with an increased risk of developing breast cancer.
Both combined HRT and oestrogen-only HRT can increase your risk of developing breast cancer, although the risk is slightly higher if you take combined HRT.
It's estimated there will be an extra 19 cases of breast cancer for every 1,000 women taking combined HRT for 10 years. The risk continues to increase slightly the longer you take HRT, but returns to normal once you stop taking it.
The prolonged use of HRT is not usually recommended, especially if you find it possible to cope with symptoms of the menopause.

Contraceptive pill
Research has shown that women who use the contraceptive pillhave a slightly increased risk of developing breast cancer.
However, the risk starts to decrease once you stop taking the pill, and your risk of breast cancer is back to normal 10 years after stopping.


LIFESTYLE FACTORS

Being overweight or obese
If you've experienced the menopause and are overweight or obese, you may be more at risk of developing breast cancer.
This is thought to be linked to the amount of oestrogen in your body, as being overweight or obese after the menopause causes more oestrogen to be produced.

Alcohol
Your risk of developing breast cancer can increase with the amount of alcohol you drink.
Research shows that for every 200 women who regularly have two alcoholic drinks a day, there are three more women with breast cancer compared with women who don't drink at all.

Radiation
Certain medical procedures that use radiation, such as X-rays and computerised tomography (CT) scans, may increase your risk of developing breast cancer very slightly.
If you currently need radiotherapy for Hodgkin lymphoma, your specialist should discuss the risk of breast cancer before your treatment begins.


DIAGNOSIS
You may be diagnosed with breast cancer after routine breast screening, or you may have symptoms that you've seen your doctor about.

SEEING YOUR DOCTOR
See your doctor as soon as possible if you notice any symptoms of breast cancer, such as an unusual lump in your breast or any change in the appearance, feel or shape of your breasts.
Your doctor will examine you. If they think your symptoms need further assessment, they'll refer you to a specialist breast cancer clinic.

TESTS AT THE BREAST CANCER CLINIC
If you have suspected breast cancer, either because of your symptoms or because your mammogram has shown an abnormality, you'll be referred to a specialist breast cancer clinic for further tests.
Mammogram and breast ultrasound
If you have symptoms and have been referred to a specialist breast unit by your doctor, you'll probably be invited to have a mammogram, which is an X-ray of your breasts. You may also need an ultrasound scan.
Your doctor may suggest that you only have a breast ultrasound scan if you're under the age of 35. This is because younger women have denser breasts, which means a mammogram isn't as effective as ultrasound in detecting cancer.
Ultrasound uses high-frequency sound waves to produce an image of the inside of your breasts, showing any lumps or abnormalities.
Your breast specialist may also suggest a breast ultrasound if they need to know whether a lump in your breast is solid or contains liquid.

BIOPSY
A biopsy is where a sample of tissue cells is taken from your breast and tested to see if it's cancerous.
You may also need a scan and a needle test on lymph nodes in your armpit (axilla) to see whether these are also affected.
Biopsies can be taken in different ways, and the type you have will depend on what your doctor knows about your condition. 
Different methods of carrying out a biopsy are discussed below.
Needle aspiration may be used to test a sample of your breast cells for cancer or drain a small fluid-filled lump (benign cyst).
Your doctor will use a small needle to extract a sample of cells, without removing any tissue.
Needle biopsy is the most common type of biopsy. A sample of tissue is taken from a lump in your breast using a large needle.
You'll have a local anaesthetic, which means you'll be awake during the procedure, but your breast will be numb.
Your doctor may suggest that you have a guided needle biopsy, usually guided by ultrasound or X-ray, but sometimes MRI, to obtain a more precise and reliable diagnosis of cancer.
This also can distinguish it from any non-invasive change, particularly ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).
Vacuum-assisted biopsy, also known as mammotome biopsy, is another type of biopsy.
During the procedure, a needle is attached to a gentle suction tube, which helps to obtain the sample and clear any bleeding from the area.

FURTHER TESTS FOR BREAST CANCER
If a diagnosis of breast cancer is confirmed, more tests will be needed to determine the stage and grade of the cancer, and work out the best method of treatment.

Scans and X-rays
Computerised tomography (CT) scans or chest X-ray and liver ultrasound scans may be needed to check whether the cancer has spread.
An MRI scan of the breast may be needed to clarify the results or assess the extent of the condition within the breast.
If your doctor thinks the cancer could have spread to your bones, you may need a bone scan.
Before having a bone scan, a substance containing a small amount of radiation known as an isotope will be injected into a vein in your arm.
This will be absorbed into your bone if it's been affected by cancer. The affected areas of bone will show up as highlighted areas on the bone scan, which is carried out using a special camera.

TESTS TO DETERMINE SPECIFIC TYPES OF TREATMENT
You'll also need tests that show whether the cancer will respond to specific types of treatment.
The results of these tests can give your doctors a more complete picture of the type of cancer you have and how best to treat it.
The types of test you could be offered are discussed below.
In some cases, breast cancer cells can be stimulated to grow by hormones that occur naturally in your body, such as oestrogen and progesterone.
If this is the case, the cancer may be treated by stopping the effects of the hormones or by lowering the level of these hormones in your body. This is known as hormone therapy.
During a hormone receptor test, a sample of cancer cells will be taken from your breast and tested to see if they respond to either oestrogen or progesterone.
If the hormone is able to attach to the cancer cells using a hormone receptor, they're known as hormone receptor positive.
While hormones can encourage the growth of some types of breast cancer, other types are stimulated by a protein called human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2).
These types of cancer can be diagnosed using a HER2 test, and are treated with medication to block the effects of HER2. This is known as biological or targeted therapy.

STAGE AND GRADE OF BREAST CANCER

Stage of breast cancer
When your breast cancer is diagnosed, the doctors will give it a stage. The stage describes the size of the cancer and how far it has spread, and helps to predict the outlook.
Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is sometimes described as stage 0. Other stages of breast cancer describe invasive breast cancer:
	•	stage is – the tumor is ""in situ"" and there's no evidence of invasion (pre-invasive)
	•	stage 1 – the tumor measures less than 2cm and the lymph nodes in the armpit aren't affected; there are no signs that the cancer has spread elsewhere in the body
	•	stage 2 – the tumor measures 2-5cm, the lymph nodes in the armpit are affected, or both; there are no signs that the cancer has spread elsewhere in the body
	•	stage 3 – the tumor measures 2-5cm and may be attached to structures in the breast, such as skin or surrounding tissues, and the lymph nodes in the armpit are affected; there are no signs that the cancer has spread elsewhere in the body
	•	stage 4 – the tumor is of any size and the cancer has spread to other parts of the body (metastasis)
This is a simplified guide. Each stage is divided into further categories: A, B and C. If you're not sure what stage you have, ask your doctor.

TNM staging system
The TNM staging system may also be used to describe breast cancer, as it can provide accurate information about the diagnosis:
	•	T – the size of the tumor
	•	N – whether the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes
	•	M – whether the cancer has spread to other parts of the body
Grade of breast cancer
The grade describes the appearance of the cancer cells.
	•	low grade (G1) – the cells, although abnormal, appear to be growing slowly
	•	medium grade (G2) – the cells look more abnormal than low-grade cells
	•	high grade (G3) – the cells look even more abnormal and are more likely to grow quickly


TREATMENT
The main treatments for breast cancer are:
	•	surgery
	•	radiotherapy
	•	chemotherapy
	•	hormone therapy
	•	biological therapy (targeted therapy)
You may have one of these treatments, or a combination. The type or combination of treatments you have will depend on how the cancer was diagnosed and the stage it's at.
Breast cancer diagnosed at screening may be at an early stage, but breast cancer diagnosed when you have symptoms may be at a later stage and require a different treatment.
Your healthcare team will discuss with you which treatments are most suitable.

Choosing the right treatment for you 
When deciding what treatment is best for you, your doctors will consider:
	•	the stage and grade of your cancer – how big it is and how far it's spread
	•	your general health
	•	whether you've experienced the menopause
You should be able to discuss your treatment with your care team at any time and ask questions.

Treatment overview
Surgery is usually the first type of treatment for breast cancer. The type of surgery you undergo will depend on the type of breast cancer you have.
Surgery is usually followed by chemotherapy or radiotherapy or, in some cases, hormone or biological treatments. Again, the treatment you'll have will depend on the type of breast cancer.
Your doctor will discuss the most suitable treatment plan with you. Chemotherapy or hormone therapy will sometimes be the first treatment.

SECONDARY BREAST CANCER
Most breast cancers are discovered in the condition's early stages. However, a small proportion of women discover that they have breast cancer after it's spread to other parts of the body (metastasis).
If this is the case, the type of treatment you have may be different. Secondary cancer, also called ""advanced"" or ""metastatic"" cancer, isn't curable.
Treatment aims to achieve remission, where the cancer shrinks or disappears, and you feel normal and able to enjoy life to the full.


SURGERY
There are two main types of breast cancer surgery:
	•	breast-conserving surgery – the cancerous lump (tumor) is removed 
	•	mastectomy – surgery to remove the whole breast
In many cases, a mastectomy can be followed by reconstructive surgery to try to recreate a bulge to replace the breast that was removed.
Studies have shown that breast-conserving surgery followed by radiotherapy is as successful as total mastectomy at treating early-stage breast cancer.

Breast-conserving surgery
Breast-conserving surgery ranges from a lumpectomy or wide local excision, where just the tumor and a little surrounding breast tissue is removed, to a partial mastectomy or quadrantectomy, where up to a quarter of the breast is removed.
If you have breast-conserving surgery, the amount of breast tissue you have removed will depend on:
	•	the type of cancer you have 
	•	the size of the tumor and where it is in your breast
	•	the amount of surrounding tissue that needs to be removed
	•	the size of your breasts
Your surgeon will always remove an area of healthy breast tissue around the cancer, which will be tested for traces of cancer.
If there's no cancer present in the healthy tissue, there's less chance that the cancer will return.
If cancer cells are found in the surrounding tissue, more tissue may need to be removed from your breast.
After having breast-conserving surgery, you'll usually be offered radiotherapy to destroy any remaining cancer cells.

Mastectomy
A mastectomy is the removal of all the breast tissue, including the nipple.
If there are no obvious signs that the cancer has spread to your lymph nodes, you may have a mastectomy, where your breast is removed, along with a sentinel lymph node biopsy.
If the cancer has spread to your lymph nodes, you'll probably need more extensive removal (clearance) of lymph nodes from the axilla under your arm.

Reconstruction
Breast reconstruction is surgery to make a new breast shape that looks like your other breast as much as possible.
Reconstruction can be carried out at the same time as a mastectomy (immediate reconstruction), or it can be carried out later (delayed reconstruction).
It can be done either by inserting a breast implant or by using tissue from another part of your body to create a new breast.

Lymph node surgery
To find out if the cancer has spread, a procedure called a sentinel lymph node biopsy may be carried out.
The sentinel lymph nodes are the first lymph nodes that the cancer cells reach if they spread. They're part of the lymph nodes under the arm (axillary lymph nodes).
The position of the sentinel lymph nodes varies, so they're identified using a combination of a radioisotope and a blue dye.
The sentinel lymph nodes are examined in the laboratory to see if there are any cancer cells present. This provides a good indicator of whether the cancer has spread.
If there are cancer cells in the sentinel nodes, you may need further surgery to remove more lymph nodes from under the arm.

Radiotherapy
Radiotherapy uses controlled doses of radiation to kill cancer cells. It's usually given after surgery and chemotherapy to kill any remaining cancer cells.
If you need radiotherapy, your treatment will begin about a month after your surgery or chemotherapy to give your body a chance to recover.
You'll probably have radiotherapy sessions three to five days a week, for three to six weeks. Each session will only last a few minutes.
The type of radiotherapy you have will depend on your cancer and the type of surgery you have. Some women may not need to have radiotherapy at all.
The types available are: 
	•	breast radiotherapy – after breast-conserving surgery, radiation is applied to the whole of the remaining breast tissue
	•	chest wall radiotherapy – after a mastectomy, radiotherapy is applied to the chest wall
	•	breast boost – some women may be offered a boost of high-dose radiotherapy in the area where the cancer was removed; however, the boost may affect the appearance of the breast, particularly if you have large breasts, and can sometimes have other side effects, including hardening of the breast tissue (fibrosis)
	•	radiotherapy to the lymph nodes – where radiotherapy is aimed at the armpit (axilla) and the surrounding area to kill any cancer that may be present in the lymph nodes
The side effects of radiotherapy include:
	•	irritation and darkening of the skin on your breast, which may lead to sore, red, weepy skin
	•	extreme tiredness (fatigue)
	•	excess fluid build-up in your arm caused by blockage of the lymph nodes under your arm (lymphoedema)

Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy involves using anti-cancer (cytotoxic) medication to kill the cancer cells.
It's usually used after surgery to destroy any cancer cells that haven't been removed. This is called adjuvant chemotherapy.
In some cases, you may have chemotherapy before surgery, which is often used to shrink a large tumor. This is called neo-adjuvant chemotherapy.
Several different medications are used for chemotherapy, and three are often given at once.
The choice of medication and the combination will depend on the type of breast cancer you have and how much it's spread.
Chemotherapy is usually given as an outpatient treatment, which means you won't have to stay in hospital overnight. The medications are usually given through a drip straight into the blood through a vein.
In some cases, you may be given tablets that you can take at home. You may have chemotherapy sessions once every two to three weeks, over a period of four to eight months, to give your body a rest in between treatments.
The main side effects of chemotherapy are caused by their influence on normal, healthy cells, such as immune cells.
Side effects include:
	•	infections
	•	loss of appetite
	•	nausea and vomiting
	•	tiredness
	•	hair loss 
	•	sore mouth
Many side effects can be prevented or controlled with medicines that your doctor can prescribe.
Chemotherapy medication can also stop the production of oestrogen in your body, which is known to encourage the growth of some breast cancers.
If you haven't experienced the menopause, your periods may stop while you're undergoing chemotherapy treatment.
After you've finished the course of chemotherapy, your ovaries should start producing oestrogen again.
However, this doesn't always happen and you may enter an early menopause. This is more likely in women over 40, as they're closer to menopausal age.
Your doctor will discuss the impact any treatment will have on your fertility with you.

Chemotherapy for secondary breast cancer
If your breast cancer has spread beyond the breast and lymph nodes to other parts of your body, chemotherapy won't cure the cancer, but it may shrink the tumor, relieve your symptoms and help lengthen your life.

Hormone treatment
Some breast cancers are stimulated to grow by the hormones oestrogen or progesterone, which are found naturally in your body.
These types of cancer are known as hormone receptor-positive cancers. Hormone therapy works by lowering the levels of hormones in your body or by stopping their effects.
The type of hormone therapy you'll have will depend on the stage and grade of your cancer, which hormone it's sensitive to, your age, whether you've experienced the menopause, and what other type of treatment you're having.
You'll probably have hormone therapy after surgery and chemotherapy, but it's sometimes given before surgery to shrink a tumor, making it easier to remove.
Hormone therapy may be used as the only treatment for breast cancer if your general health prevents you having surgery, chemotherapy or radiotherapy.
In most cases, you'll need to take hormone therapy for up to five years after having surgery. If your breast cancer isn't sensitive to hormones, hormone therapy will have no effect.

Tamoxifen
Tamoxifen stops oestrogen from binding to oestrogen-receptor-positive cancer cells. It's taken every day as a tablet or liquid.
It can cause several side effects, including:
	•	tiredness
	•	changes to your periods
	•	nausea and vomiting
	•	hot flushes
	•	aching joints
	•	headaches 
	•	weight gain

Aromatase inhibitors
If you've experienced the menopause, you may be offered an aromatase inhibitor.
This type of medication works by blocking aromatase, a substance that helps produce oestrogen in the body after the menopause. Before the menopause, oestrogen is made by the ovaries.
Three aromatase inhibitors may be offered. These are anastrozole, exemestane and letrozole. These are taken as a tablet once a day.
Side effects include:
	•	hot flushes and sweats
	•	lack of interest in sex (loss of libido)
	•	nausea and vomiting
	•	tiredness
	•	aching joints and bone pain
	•	headaches
	•	skin rashes

Ovarian ablation or suppression
In women who haven't experienced the menopause, oestrogen is produced by the ovaries. Ovarian ablation or suppression stops the ovaries working and producing oestrogen.
Ablation can be carried out using surgery or radiotherapy. It stops the ovaries working permanently and means you'll experience the menopause early.
Ovarian suppression involves using a medication called goserelin, which is a luteinising hormone-releasing hormone agonist (LHRHa).
Your periods will stop while you're taking it, although they should start again once your treatment is complete.
If you're approaching the menopause (around the age of 50), your periods may not start again after you stop taking goserelin.
Goserelin is taken as an injection once a month and can cause menopausal side effects, including:
	•	hot flushes and sweats
	•	mood swings
	•	trouble sleeping

Biological therapy (targeted therapy)
Some breast cancers are stimulated to grow by a protein called human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). These cancers are called HER2-positive.
Biological therapy works by stopping the effects of HER2 and helping your immune system to fight off cancer cells.
If you have high levels of the HER2 protein and are able to have biological therapy, you'll probably be prescribed a medicine called trastuzumab.
Trastuzumab, also known by the brand name Herceptin, is usually used after chemotherapy.
Trastuzumab
Trastuzumab is a type of biological therapy known as a monoclonal antibody.
Antibodies occur naturally in your body and are made by your immune system to destroy harmful cells, such as viruses and bacteria.
The trastuzumab antibody targets and destroys cancer cells that are HER2-positive.
Trastuzumab is usually given intravenously, through a drip. It's also sometimes available as an injection under the skin (a subcutaneous injection).
You'll have the treatment in hospital. Each treatment session takes up to one hour, and the number of sessions you need will depend on whether you have early or more advanced breast cancer.
On average, you'll need a session once every three weeks for early breast cancer, and weekly sessions if your cancer is more advanced.
Trastuzumab can cause side effects, including heart problems. This means that it's not suitable if you have a heart problem, such as angina, uncontrolled high blood pressure (hypertension), or heart valve disease.
If you need to take trastuzumab, you'll have regular tests on your heart to make sure it's not causing any problems.
Other side effects of trastuzumab may include:
	•	an initial allergic reaction to the medication, which can cause nausea, wheezing, chills and fever
	•	diarrhoea
	•	tiredness
	•	aches and pains

Clinical trials
A great deal of progress has been made in breast cancer treatment, and more women now live longer and have fewer side effects from treatment.
These advances were discovered in clinical trials, where new treatments and treatment combinations are compared with standard ones.
All cancer trials in the UK are carefully overseen to ensure they're worthwhile and safely conducted. In fact, participants in clinical trials can do better overall than those in routine care.
If you're asked to take part in a trial, you'll be given an information sheet and, if you want to take part, you'll be asked to sign a consent form. You can refuse or withdraw from a clinical trial without it affecting your care.

Psychological help
Dealing with cancer can be a huge challenge for both patients and their families. It can cause emotional and practical difficulties.
Many women have to cope with the removal of part or all of a breast, which can be very upsetting.
It often helps to talk about your feelings or other difficulties with a trained counsellor or therapist. You can ask for this kind of help at any stage of your illness.
There are various ways to find help and support. Your hospital doctor or specialist nurse can refer you to a counsellor.
If you're feeling depressed, talk to your doctor. A course of antidepressant drugs may help, or your doctor can arrange for you to see a counsellor or psychotherapist.
It can help to talk to someone who's been through the same thing as you. Many organizations have helplines and online forums. They can also put you in touch with other people who've had cancer treatment.

Complementary therapies
Complementary therapies are holistic therapies that can promote physical and emotional wellbeing.
They're given alongside conventional treatments and include:
	•	relaxation techniques
	•	massage
	•	aromatherapy
	•	acupuncture
Complementary therapy can help some women cope with diagnosis and treatment, and provide a break from the treatment plan.
Your hospital or breast unit may be able to provide access to complementary therapies or suggest where you can get them.
It's important to speak to your breast cancer specialist nurse about any complementary therapy you wish to use to make sure it doesn't interfere with your conventional treatment.

LIVING WITH
Breast cancer can affect your daily life in different ways, depending on what stage it's at and the treatment you're receiving.
How women cope with their diagnosis and treatment varies from person to person, but there are several forms of support if you need it. Not all of them work for everybody, but one or more of them should help.
You could:
	•	talk to your friends and family – they can be a powerful support system
	•	communicate with other people in the same situation
	•	find out as much as possible about your condition
	•	avoid doing too much or overexerting yourself
	•	make time for yourself

RECOVERY AND FOLLOW-UP

Recovery
Most women with breast cancer have an operation as part of their treatment. Getting back to normal after surgery can take some time. It's important to take things slowly and give yourself time to recover.
During this time, avoid lifting things – for example, children or heavy shopping bags – and avoid heavy housework. You may also be advised not to drive.
Read more about recovering from an operation.
Some other treatments, particularly radiotherapy and chemotherapy, can make you very tired.
You may need to take a break from some of your normal activities for a while. Don't be afraid to ask for practical help from family and friends.

Follow-up
After your treatment has finished, you'll be invited for regular check-ups, usually every three months for the first year.
If you've had early breast cancer, your healthcare team will agree a care plan with you after your treatment has finished.
This plan contains the details of your follow-up. You'll receive a copy of the plan, which will also be sent to your doctor.
During the check-up, your doctor will examine you and may carry out blood tests or X-rays to see how your cancer is responding to treatment.
You should also be offered a mammogram every year for the first five years after your treatment.
Long-term complications
Although it's rare, your treatment for breast cancer may cause new problems, such as:
	•	pain and stiffness in your arms and shoulders may occur after surgery, and the skin in these areas may be tight
	•	a build-up of excess lymph fluid that causes swelling (lymphoedema) – this may occur if surgery or radiotherapy damages the lymphatic drainage system in the armpit
Talk to your healthcare team if you experience these or any other long-term effects of treatment.

Your body and breasts after treatment
Dealing with changes to your body
A diagnosis of breast cancer may change how you think about your body. All women react differently to the bodily changes that happen as a result of breast cancer treatment.
Some women react positively, but others find it more difficult to cope. It's important to give yourself time to come to terms with any changes to your body.

Early menopause
Although most cases of breast cancer occur in women over 50 who have experienced the menopause, some younger women have to cope with an early menopause brought on by cancer treatment.
Symptoms can include:
	•	hot flushes
	•	vaginal dryness
	•	loss of sexual desire
Talk to your healthcare team about any symptoms you have and they'll be able to help.

Prosthesis
An external breast prosthesis is an artificial breast, which can be worn inside your bra to replace the volume of the breast that's been removed.
Soon after a mastectomy, you'll be given a lightweight foam breast to wear until the area affected by surgery or radiotherapy has healed.
After it's healed, you'll be offered a silicone prosthesis. Prostheses come in many different shapes and sizes, and you should be able to find one that suits you.

Reconstruction
If you didn't have immediate breast reconstruction carried out when you had a mastectomy, you can have reconstruction later. This is called a delayed reconstruction.
There are two main methods of breast reconstruction:
	•	reconstruction using your own tissue
	•	reconstruction using an implant
The type that's most suitable for you will depend on many factors, including the treatment you've had, any ongoing treatment, and the size of your breasts. Talk to your healthcare team about which reconstruction is suitable for you.


RELATIONSHIPS WITH FRIENDS AND FAMILY
It's not always easy to talk about cancer, either for you or your family and friends. You may sense that some people feel awkward around you or avoid you.
Being open about how you feel and what your family and friends can do to help may put them at ease. However, don't be afraid to tell them that you need some time to yourself if that's what you need.

Your sex life
Breast cancer and its treatment can affect your sex life. It's common for women to lose interest in sex after breast cancer treatment.
Your treatment may leave you feeling very tired. You may feel shocked, confused or depressed about being diagnosed with cancer.
You may be upset by the changes to your body, or grieve the loss of your breasts or, in some cases, fertility.
It's understandable that you may not feel like having sex while coping with all this. Try to share your feelings with your partner.
If you have problems with sex that aren't getting better with time, you may want to speak to a counsellor or sex therapist.

Talk to other people
Your doctor or nurse may be able to answer any questions you have about your cancer or treatment.
You may find it helpful to talk to a trained counsellor or psychologist, or someone at a specialist helpline. Your doctor surgery will have information on these.
Some people find it helpful to talk to other people who have breast cancer, either at a local support group or on an internet chatroom.


PREVENTION
As the causes of breast cancer aren't fully understood, it's not known if it can be prevented altogether.
Some treatments are available to reduce the risk in women who have a higher risk of developing the condition than the general population.

Diet and lifestyle
Regular exercise and a healthy, balanced diet are recommended for all women as they can help prevent many conditions, including heart disease, diabetes and many forms of cancer.
Studies have looked at the link between breast cancer and diet, and although there are no definite conclusions, there are benefits for women who:
	•	maintain a healthy weight
	•	exercise regularly
	•	have a low intake of saturated fat and alcohol
Use our healthy weight calculator to check if you're a healthy weight.
It's also been suggested that regular exercise can reduce your risk of developing breast cancer by as much as a third.
If you've been through the menopause, it's particularly important that you're not overweight or obese. This is because these conditions cause more oestrogen to be produced by your body, which can increase the risk of breast cancer.

Breastfeeding
Studies have shown women who breastfeed are statistically less likely to develop breast cancer than those who don't.
The reasons aren't fully understood, but it could be because women don't ovulate as regularly while they're breastfeeding and oestrogen levels remain stable.

Treatments to reduce your risk
If you have an increased risk of developing breast cancer, treatment is available to reduce your risk.
Your level of risk is determined by factors such as your age, your family's medical history, and the results of genetic tests.
You'll usually be referred to a specialist genetics service if it's thought you have an increased risk of breast cancer. Healthcare professionals working at these services should discuss treatment options with you.
The two main treatments are surgery to remove the breasts (mastectomy) or medication. These are described in more detail below.
Mastectomy
A mastectomy is surgery to remove the breasts. It can be used to treat breast cancer, and can reduce the chances of developing the condition in the small number of women from high-risk families.
By removing as much breast tissue as possible, a mastectomy can reduce your risk of breast cancer by up to 90%.
However, like all operations, there's a risk of complications, and having your breasts removed can have a significant effect on your body image and sexual relationships.
If you want to, you can usually choose to have a breast reconstruction either during the mastectomy operation or at a later date.
During breast reconstruction surgery, your original breast shape is recreated using either breast implants or tissue from elsewhere in your body.
An alternative is to use breast prostheses. These are artificial breasts that can be worn inside your bra.
An alternative to mastectomy is a nipple-sparing mastectomy, where the whole mammary gland is removed, but the skin envelope is preserved. This isn't widely available at the moment, but it's being used more often and can achieve excellent results.

MEDICATION
Three medicines are available on the NHS for women at an increased risk of breast cancer:
	•	tamoxifen – for women who either have or haven't been through the menopause
	•	anastrozole – for women who've been through the menopause
	•	raloxifene – for women who've been through the menopause
These medicines are usually taken once a day for five years. They can reduce your risk of breast cancer while you're taking them and possibly for several years afterwards.
Side effects of these medicines can include:
	•	hot flushes
	•	sweating
	•	feeling sick
	•	tiredness
	•	leg cramps
There's also a small risk of more serious problems, such as weak bones (osteoporosis), blood clots or womb cancer.
If your doctor suggests taking medication to reduce your breast cancer risk, ask them about the benefits and risks of each medicine.",2018-07-08T14:44:55.633Z
"Symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, and everything you need to know about diabetes. ",DIABETES,information2,putiancuarterocam19@gmail.com,"Diabetes is a lifelong condition that causes a person's blood sugar level to become too high.
There are two main types of diabetes:
	•	type 1 diabetes – where the body's immune system attacks and destroys the cells that produce insulin
	•	type 2 diabetes – where the body doesn't produce enough insulin, or the body's cells don't react to insulin
Type 2 diabetes is far more common than type 1.
During pregnancy, some women have such high levels of blood glucose that their body is unable to produce enough insulin to absorb it all. This is known as gestational diabetes.


PRE-DIABETES
Many more people have blood sugar levels above the normal range, but not high enough to be diagnosed as having diabetes.
This is sometimes known as pre-diabetes. If your blood sugar level is above the normal range, your risk of developing full-blown diabetes is increased.
It's very important for diabetes to be diagnosed as early as possible because it will get progressively worse if left untreated.


WHEN TO SEE A DOCTOR
Visit your doctor as soon as possible if you experience the main symptoms of diabetes, which include:
	•	feeling very thirsty
	•	urinating more frequently than usual, particularly at night
	•	feeling very tired
	•	weight loss and loss of muscle bulk
	•	itching around the penis or vagina, or frequent episodes of thrush
	•	cuts or wounds that heal slowly
	•	blurred vision
Type 1 diabetes can develop quickly over weeks or even days.
Many people have type 2 diabetes for years without realizing because the early symptoms tend to be general.


CAUSES OF DIABETES
The amount of sugar in the blood is controlled by a hormone called insulin, which is produced by the pancreas (a gland behind the stomach).
When food is digested and enters your bloodstream, insulin moves glucose out of the blood and into cells, where it's broken down to produce energy.
However, if you have diabetes, your body is unable to break down glucose into energy. This is because there's either not enough insulin to move the glucose, or the insulin produced doesn't work properly.
Although there are no lifestyle changes you can make to lower your risk of type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes is often linked to being overweight.


LIVING WITH DIABETES
If you're diagnosed with diabetes, you'll need to eat healthily, take regular exercise and carry out regular blood tests to ensure your blood glucose levels stay balanced.
You can use the BMI healthy weight calculator to check whether you're a healthy weight.
People diagnosed with type 1 diabetes also require regular insulin injections for the rest of their life.
As type 2 diabetes is a progressive condition, medication may eventually be required, usually in the form of tablets.


DIABETIC EYE SCREENING
Everyone with diabetes aged 12 or over should be invited to have their eyes screened once a year.
If you have diabetes, your eyes are at risk from diabetic retinopathy, a condition that can lead to sight loss if it's not treated.
Screening, which involves a half-hour check to examine the back of the eyes, is a way of detecting the condition early so it can be treated more effectively.",2018-07-08T20:55:10.605Z
"Symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, and everything you need to know about hypertension.",HYPERTENSION,information2,putiancuarterocam19@gmail.com,"OVERVIEW
High blood pressure, or hypertension, rarely has noticeable symptoms. But if untreated, it increases your risk of serious problems such as heart attacks and strokes.

More than one in four adults in the UK have high blood pressure, although many won't realize it.

The only way to find out if your blood pressure is high is to have your blood pressure checked.


WHAT IS HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE?
Blood pressure is recorded with two numbers. The systolic pressure (higher number) is the force at which your heart pumps blood around your body.

The diastolic pressure (lower number) is the resistance to the blood flow in the blood vessels. They're both measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg).

As a general guide:
	•	high blood pressure is considered to be 140/90mmHg or higher
	•	ideal blood pressure is considered to be between 90/60mmHg and 120/80mmHg
	•	low blood pressure is considered to be 90/60mmHg or lower

A blood pressure reading between 120/80mmHg and 140/90mmHg could mean you're at risk of developing high blood pressure if you don't take steps to keep your blood pressure under control.

Find out more about what your blood pressure result means.


RISKS OF HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE
If your blood pressure is too high, it puts extra strain on your blood vessels, heart and other organs, such as the brain, kidneys and eyes.

Persistent high blood pressure can increase your risk of a number of serious and potentially life-threatening conditions, such as:
	•	heart disease
	•	heart attacks
	•	strokes
	•	heart failure
	•	peripheral arterial disease
	•	aortic aneurysms
	•	kidney disease
	•	vascular dementia

If you have high blood pressure, reducing it even a small amount can help lower your risk of these conditions.


CHECK YOUR BLOOD PRESSSURE
The only way of knowing whether you have high blood pressure is to have a blood pressure test.

All adults over 40 are advised to have their blood pressure checked at least every five years. Getting this done is easy and could save your life.

You can get your blood pressure tested at a number of places, including:
	•	at your surgeon
	•	at some pharmacies
	•	in some workplaces
You can also check your blood pressure yourself with a home blood pressure monitor.


REDUCE YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE
The following lifestyle changes can help prevent and lower high blood pressure:
	•	reduce the amount of salt you eat and have a generally healthy diet
	•	cut back on alcohol if you drink too much
	•	lose weight if you're overweight
	•	exercise regularly
	•	cut down on caffeine
	•	stop smoking
	•	try to get at least six hours of sleep a night

Some people with high blood pressure may also need to take one or more medicines to stop their blood pressure getting too high.

Medicines for high blood pressure
If you're diagnosed with high blood pressure, your doctor may recommend taking one or more medicines to keep it under control.

These usually need to be taken once a day.

Common blood pressure medications include:
	•	ACE inhibitors – such as enalapril, lisinopril, perindopril and ramipril
	•	angiotensin-2 receptor blockers (ARBs) – such as candesartan, irbesartan, losartan, valsartan and olmesartan
	•	calcium channel blockers – such as amlodipine, felodipine and nifedipine or diltiazem and verapamil.
	•	diuretics – such as indapamide and bendroflumethiazide
	•	beta-blockers – such as atenolol and bisoprolol
	•	alpha-blockers – such as doxazosin
	•	renin inhibitors – such as aliskiren
	•	other diuretics – such as amiloride and spironolactone

The medication recommended for you will depend on things like how high your blood pressure is and your age.

CAUSES
In most cases, it's not clear exactly what causes high blood pressure (hypertension). But there are several things that can increase your risk.

Who's at risk of high blood pressure?
Factors that can raise your risk of developing high blood pressure include:
	•	age – the risk of developing high blood pressure increases as you get older
	•	a family history of high blood pressure
	•	being of African or Caribbean origin
	•	a high amount of salt in your food 
	•	a lack of exercise
	•	being overweight or obese
	•	regularly drinking large amounts of alcohol
	•	smoking
	•	long-term sleep deprivation
Making healthy lifestyle changes can help keep your blood pressure at a normal level.


Known causes of high blood pressure
In about 1 in 20 cases, high blood pressure occurs as the result of an underlying condition, medication or drug.

Conditions that can cause high blood pressure include:
	•	kidney disease
	•	diabetes
	•	long-term kidney infections
	•	obstructive sleep apnoea – a condition in which the walls of the throat relax and narrow during sleep, interrupting normal breathing
	•	glomerulonephritis – damage to the tiny filters inside the kidneys
	•	narrowing of the arteries supplying the kidneys
	•	hormone problems – such as an underactive thyroid, an overactive thyroid, Cushing's syndrome, acromegaly, increased levels of the hormone aldosterone (hyperaldosteronism) and phaeochromocytoma
	•	lupus – a condition in which the immune system attacks parts of the body such as the skin, joints and organs
	•	scleroderma – a condition that causes thickened skin, and sometimes problems with organs and blood vessels
Medicines and drugs that can increase your blood pressure include:
	•	the combined oral contraceptive pill
	•	steroid medication
	•	non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) – such as ibuprofen and naproxen
	•	some over-the-counter cough and cold remedies
	•	some herbal remedies – particularly those containing liquorice
	•	some recreational drugs – such as cocaine and amphetamines
	•	some selective serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (SSNRI) antidepressants – such as venlafaxine

In these cases, your blood pressure may return to normal once you stop taking the medicine or drug.

DIAGNOSIS
High blood pressure (hypertension) doesn't usually have any symptoms, so the only way to find out if you have it is to get your blood pressure checked.

Healthy adults aged over 40 should have their blood pressure checked at least once every five years.

If you're at an increased risk of high blood pressure, you should have your blood pressure checked more often – ideally once a year.

Having this done is easy and could save your life.


WHERE TO GET BLOOD PRESSURE TEST
You can ask for a blood pressure check – you don't have to wait to be offered one.

Blood pressure testing is available:
	•	at your surgeon – by a doctor, practice nurse, healthcare assistant or self-service machine
	•	at some pharmacies
	•	in some workplaces
	•	at a health event
You can also test your blood pressure at home using a home testing kit.


THE TEST
A stethoscope, arm cuff, pump and dial was normally used to measure your blood pressure, but automatic devices with sensors and digital displays are commonly used nowadays.

It's best to sit down with your back supported and legs uncrossed for at least five minutes before the test.

You'll usually need to roll up your sleeves or remove any long-sleeved clothing so the cuff can be placed around your upper arm. Try to relax and avoid talking while the test is carried out.

During the test:
	•	you hold out one of your arms so it's at the same level as your heart, and the cuff is placed around it – your arm should be supported in this position with a cushion or the arm of a chair, for example 
	•	the cuff is pumped up to restrict the blood flow in your arm – this squeezing may feel a bit uncomfortable, but only lasts a few seconds
	•	the pressure in the cuff is slowly released and detectors sense vibrations in your arteries – a doctor will use a stethoscope to detect these if your blood pressure is measured manually
	•	the pressure in the cuff is recorded at two points as the blood flow starts to return to your arm – these measurements are used to give your blood pressure reading

You can usually find out your result straight away, either from the healthcare professional carrying out the test or on the digital display.

If your blood pressure is high, you may be advised to record your blood pressure at home to confirm whether you have high blood pressure.


Ambulatory (24-hour) monitoring
Having a raised blood pressure reading in one test doesn't necessarily mean you have high blood pressure.

Blood pressure can fluctuate throughout the day. Feeling anxious or stressed when you visit your doctor can also raise your blood pressure.

If you have a high reading, you may be asked to take some readings with a home blood pressure monitor or wear a 24-hour monitor that checks your blood pressure throughout the day. This will confirm whether you have consistently high blood pressure.

This is known as 24-hour or ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). 


HOME TESTING
Blood pressure tests can also be carried out at home using your own digital blood pressure monitor.

Like 24-hour or ambulatory monitoring, this can give a better reflection of your blood pressure. It can also allow you to monitor your condition more easily in the long term.

You can buy a variety of low-cost monitors so you can test your blood pressure at home or while you're out and about.

It's important to make sure you use equipment that has been properly tested.

UDERSTANDING YOUR BLOOD PRESURE READING
Blood pressure is measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg) and is given as two figures:
	•	systolic pressure – the pressure when your heart pushes blood out
	•	diastolic pressure – the pressure when your heart rests between beats

For example, if your blood pressure is ""140 over 90"", or 140/90mmHg, it means you have a systolic pressure of 140mmHg and a diastolic pressure of 90mmHg.

As a general guide:
	•	high blood pressure is considered to be 140/90mmHg or higher (or an average of 135/85mmHg at home)
	•	ideal blood pressure is considered to be between 90/60mmHg and 120/80mmHg
	•	low blood pressure is considered to be 90/60mmHg or lower
A blood pressure reading between 120/80mmHg and 140/90mmHg could mean you're at risk of developing high blood pressure if you don't take steps to keep your blood pressure under control.


TREATMENT
Simple lifestyle changes can often help reduce high blood pressure (hypertension), although some people may need to take medication as well.
Your doctor can advise you about changes you can make to your lifestyle and discuss whether they think you would benefit from medication.

When treatment is recommended
Everyone with high blood pressure is advised to make healthy lifestyle changes.

Whether medication is recommended depends on your blood pressure reading and your risk of developing problems such as heart attacks or strokes.

Your doctor will carry out some blood and urine tests, and ask questions about your health to determine your risk of other problems:
	•	if your blood pressure is consistently above 140/90mmHg (or 135/85mmHg at home) but your risk of other problems is low – you'll be advised to make some changes to your lifestyle
	•	if your blood pressure is consistently above 140/90mmHg (or 135/85mmHg at home) and your risk of other problems is high – you'll be offered medication to lower your blood pressure, in addition to lifestyle changes
	•	if your blood pressure is consistently above 160/100mmHg – you'll be offered medication to lower your blood pressure, in addition to lifestyle changes


LIFESTYLE CHANGES
There are some changes you could make to your lifestyle to reduce high blood pressure. Some of these will lower your blood pressure in a matter of weeks, while others may take longer.

These include:
	•	cutting your salt intake to less than 6g (0.2oz) a day – find out how you can reduce the amount of salt in your diet
	•	eating a low-fat, balanced diet  – including plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables; get tips on eating more healthily
	•	being active – read some tips about getting more exercise
	•	cutting down on alcohol – get tips on cutting down, including downloading a drinks diary and keeping track of your drinking 
	•	losing weight – find out what your ideal weight is using the BMI healthy weight calculator and read advice about losing weight if you're overweight
	•	drinking less caffeine – found in coffee, tea and cola
	•	stopping smoking
	•	getting at least six hours of sleep a night if you can

You can take these steps today, regardless of whether or not you're taking blood pressure medication. In fact, by making these changes early on you may be able to avoid needing medication.


MEDICATION FOR HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE
Several medications can be used to help control high blood pressure. Many people need to take a combination of different medicines.
The medication recommended for you at first will depend on your age and ethnicity:
	•	if you're under 55 years of age – you'll usually be offered an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin-2 receptor blocker (ARB)
	•	if you're aged 55 or older, or you're any age and of African or Caribbean origin – you'll usually be offered a calcium channel blocker

You may need to take blood pressure medication for the rest of your life. But your doctor might be able to reduce or stop your treatment if your blood pressure stays under control for several years.

It's really important to take your medications as directed. If you miss doses, it won't work as effectively. The medication won't necessarily make you feel any different, but this doesn't mean it's not working.

Medications used to treat high blood pressure can have side effects, but most people don't experience any. If you do, changing medication will often help.

ACE inhibitors
Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reduce blood pressure by relaxing your blood vessels.
Common examples are enalapril, lisinopril, perindopril and ramipril.
The most common side effect is a persistent dry cough. Other possible side effects include headaches, dizziness and a rash.

Angiotensin-2 receptor blockers (ARBs)
ARBs work in a similar way to ACE inhibitors. They're often recommended if ACE inhibitors cause troublesome side effects.
Common examples are candesartan, irbesartan, losartan, valsartan and olmesartan.
Possible side effects include dizziness, headaches, and cold or flu-like symptoms.

Calcium channel blockers
Calcium channel blockers reduce blood pressure by widening your blood vessels.
Common examples are amlodipine, felodipine and nifedipine. Other medicines such as diltiazem and verapamil are also available.
Possible side effects include headaches, swollen ankles and constipation.
Drinking grapefruit juice while taking some calcium channel blockers can increase your risk of side effects.

Diuretics
Sometimes known as water pills, diuretics work by flushing excess water and salt from the body through urine. They're often used if calcium channel blockers cause troublesome side effects.
Common examples are indapamide and bendroflumethiazide.
Possible side effects include dizziness when standing up, increased thirst, needing to go to the toilet frequently, and a rash.
Low potassium level (hypokalaemia) and low sodium level (hyponatraemia) may also be seen after long-term use.

Beta-blockers
Beta-blockers can reduce blood pressure by making your heart beat more slowly and with less force.
They used to be a popular treatment for high blood pressure, but now only tend to be used when other treatments haven't worked.
This is because beta-blockers are considered less effective than other blood pressure medications.
Common examples are atenolol and bisoprolol.
Possible side effects include dizziness, headaches, tiredness, and cold hands and feet.


PREVENTION
High blood pressure can often be prevented or reduced by eating healthily, maintaining a healthy weight, taking regular exercise, drinking alcohol in moderation and not smoking.

Healthy diet
Cut down on the amount of salt in your food and eat plenty of fruit and vegetables. The Eatwell Guide highlights the different types of food that make up our diet, and shows the proportions we should eat them in to have a well-balanced and healthy diet.
Salt raises your blood pressure. The more salt you eat, the higher your blood pressure. Aim to eat less than 6g (0.2oz) of salt a day, which is about a teaspoonful.
Eating a low-fat diet that includes lots of fibre – such as wholegrain rice, bread and pasta – and plenty of fruit and vegetables also helps lower blood pressure. Aim to eat five portions of fruit and vegetables every day.

Limit your alcohol intake
Regularly drinking alcohol above recommended limits can raise your blood pressure over time.
Staying within these recommended levels is the best way to reduce your risk of developing high blood pressure:
	•	men and women are advised not to regularly drink more than 14 units a week
	•	spread your drinking over three days or more if you drink as much as 14 units a week

Alcohol is also high in calories, which will make you gain weight and can further increase your blood pressure.

Lose weight
Being overweight forces your heart to work harder to pump blood around your body, which can raise your blood pressure.
If you do need to shed some weight, it's worth remembering that just losing a few pounds will make a big difference to your blood pressure and overall health.

Get active
Being active and taking regular exercise lowers blood pressure by keeping your heart and blood vessels in good condition.
Regular exercise can also help you lose weight, which will also help lower your blood pressure.
Adults should do at least 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) of moderate-intensity aerobic activity such as cycling or fast walking every week.
Physical activity can include anything from sport to walking and gardening. 

Cut down on caffeine
Drinking more than four cups of coffee a day may increase your blood pressure. 
If you're a big fan of coffee, tea or other caffeine-rich drinks, such as cola and some energy drinks, consider cutting down.
It's fine to drink tea and coffee as part of a balanced diet, but it's important that these drinks are not your main or only source of fluid.

Stop smoking
Smoking doesn't directly cause high blood pressure, but it puts you at much higher risk of a heart attack and stroke.
Smoking, like high blood pressure, will cause your arteries to narrow. If you smoke and have high blood pressure, your arteries will narrow much more quickly, and your risk of heart or lung disease in the future is dramatically increased.

Get a good night's sleep
Long-term sleep deprivation is associated with a rise in blood pressure and an increased risk of hypertension. It's a good idea to try to get at least six hours of sleep a night if you can.",2018-07-08T21:12:30.131Z
"Symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, and everything you need to know about kidney disease.",KIDNEY DISEASE,information2,putiancuarterocam19@gmail.com,"OVERVIEW
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a long-term condition where the kidneys don't work as well as they should.

It's a common condition often associated with getting older. Anyone can get it, although it's more common in black people and people of south Asian origin.

CKD can get gradually worse over time and eventually the kidneys may stop working altogether, but this is uncommon. Many people with kidney disease are able to live long, largely normal lives.


Symptoms of CKD
There are usually no symptoms of kidney disease in the early stages. It may only be picked up if blood or urine tests carried out for another reason detect a possible problem with your kidneys.

When it reaches a more advanced stage, symptoms can include:
	•	tiredness
	•	swollen ankles, feet or hands
	•	shortness of breath
	•	feeling sick
	•	blood in your urine

See your doctor if you have persistent or worrying symptoms that you think could be caused by kidney disease.


Causes of CKD
Kidney disease is usually caused by other conditions that put a strain on the kidneys. Often it's the result of a combination of different problems.

CKD can be caused by:
	•	high blood pressure – over time, this can put strain on the small blood vessels in the kidneys and stop the kidneys working properly
	•	diabetes – too much glucose in your blood can damage the tiny filters in the kidneys
	•	high cholesterol – this can cause a build-up of fatty deposits in the blood vessels supplying your kidneys, which can make it harder for them to work properly
	•	kidney infections
	•	glomerulonephritis – kidney inflammation
	•	polycystic kidney disease – an inherited condition where growths called cysts develop in the kidneys
	•	blockages in the flow of urine – for example, from recurrent kidney stones or an enlarged prostate
	•	long-term, regular use of certain medicines – such as lithium and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)

You can help prevent CKD by making healthy lifestyle changes and ensuring any underlying conditions you have are well controlled.


Tests for CKD
CKD can be diagnosed using blood and urine tests. These tests are used to look for high levels of certain substances in your blood and urine that are signs your kidneys aren't working properly.

If you're at a high risk of developing kidney disease – for example, you have one of the conditions mentioned above – you may be advised to have regular tests to check for CKD so it's picked up at an early stage.

The results of your blood and urine tests can be used to tell the stage of your kidney disease. This is a number that reflects how severe the damage to your kidneys is, with a higher number indicating more serious CKD.


Treatments for CKD
There's no cure for CKD, but treatment can help relieve the symptoms and stop it getting worse.

Your treatment will depend on how severe your kidney disease is.

The main treatments are:
	•	lifestyle changes to ensure you remain as healthy as possible
	•	medication to control associated problems such as high blood pressure and high cholesterol
	•	dialysis – treatment to replicate some of the kidney's functions; this may be necessary in advanced CKD
	•	kidney transplant – this may also be necessary in advanced CKD

You'll also be advised to have regular check-ups to monitor your condition.
Read more about how CKD is treated and living with CKD.


Outlook for CKD
CKD can range from a mild condition with no or few symptoms, to a very serious condition where the kidneys stop working, sometimes called kidney failure.

Most people with CKD will be able to control their condition with medication and regular check-ups. CKD only progresses to kidney failure in around 1 in 50 people with the condition.

But if you have CKD, even if it's mild, you're at an increased risk of developing other serious problems, such as cardiovascular disease. This is a group of conditions affecting the heart and blood vessels, which includes heart attacks and strokes.

Cardiovascular disease is one of the main causes of death in people with kidney disease, although healthy lifestyle changes and medication can help reduce your risk of developing it.

__________________________________________________________________

SYMPTOMS
Many people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) won't have symptoms because it doesn't usually cause problems until it reaches an advanced stage.

Early stages of CKD
There don't tend to be any symptoms of kidney disease when it's at an early stage.

This is because the body is usually able to cope with a significant reduction in kidney function.

Kidney disease is often only diagnosed at this stage after a routine test, such as a blood or urine test, detects a possible problem.

If it's picked up at this stage, you may only need medication and regular tests to monitor it. This can help stop it becoming more advanced.

Later stages of CKD
A number of symptoms can develop if kidney disease isn't picked up early on or it gets worse despite treatment.

Symptoms can include:
	•	weight loss and poor appetite
	•	swollen ankles, feet or hands – as a result of water retention (oedema) 
	•	shortness of breath
	•	tiredness
	•	blood in your urine
	•	an increased need to pee – particularly at night 
	•	difficulty sleeping (insomnia)
	•	itchy skin
	•	muscle cramps
	•	feeling sick
	•	headaches
	•	erectile dysfunction in men

This stage of CKD is known as kidney failure, end-stage renal disease or established renal failure. It may eventually require treatment with dialysis or a kidney transplant.


WHEN TO GET MEDICAL ADVICE
See your doctor if you have persistent or worrying symptoms that you think could be caused by kidney disease.

The symptoms of kidney disease can be caused by many less serious conditions, so it's important to get a proper diagnosis.

If you do have CKD, it's best to get it diagnosed as soon as possible. Kidney disease can be diagnosed by having blood and urine tests.

DIAGNOSIS
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) can be diagnosed with blood and urine tests.
In many cases, it's only picked up because a routine blood or urine test indicates that the kidneys may not be working normally.

Who should be tested for CKD?
See your doctor if you have persistent symptoms of CKD, such as:
	•	weight loss or poor appetite
	•	swollen ankles, feet or hands (oedema)
	•	shortness of breath
	•	tiredness
	•	blood in your urine
	•	peeing more than usual, particularly at night
They can look for other possible causes and arrange tests if necessary.

But as kidney disease often has no symptoms in the early stages, some people at a higher risk should ideally be tested regularly.

Regular testing is recommended if you have:
	•	high blood pressure
	•	diabetes
	•	acute kidney injury – sudden damage to the kidneys that causes them to stop working properly
	•	cardiovascular disease – conditions that affect the heart, arteries and veins, such as coronary heart disease or heart failure
	•	other conditions that can affect the kidneys – such as kidney stones, an enlarged prostate or lupus
	•	a family history of advanced CKD or an inherited kidney disease
	•	protein or blood in their urine where there's no known cause

You're also more likely to develop kidney disease if you're black or south Asian.
People taking long-term medications that can affect the kidneys, such as lithium, omeprazole or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), should also be tested regularly.

Talk to your GP if you think you may need regular testing for kidney disease.


TESTS FOR CKD

Blood test
The main test for kidney disease is a blood test that's used to work out how well your kidneys are working. The test measures the levels of a waste product called creatinine in your blood.

Using this result, a calculation that takes into account your age, gender and ethnic group is then done to work out how many milliliters of waste your kidneys are able to filter in a minute.

This measurement is known as your estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).
Healthy kidneys should be able to filter more than 90ml/min. You may have kidney disease if your result is lower than this.

Urine tests
Urine tests are also usually carried out to:
	•	check the levels of substances called albumin and creatinine in your urine – known as the albumin:creatinine ratio, or ACR
	•	check for blood or protein in your urine

Alongside your eGFR measurement, these tests can help give a more accurate picture of how well your kidneys are working.

Other tests
Sometimes other tests are also used to assess the level of damage to your kidneys.

These may include:
	•	an ultrasound scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan or computerised tomography (CT) scan – to see what the kidneys look like and check whether there are any blockages
	•	a kidney biopsy – a small sample of kidney tissue is removed using a needle so the cells can be examined under a microscope for signs of damage

Test results and stages of CKD
Your test results can be used to determine how damaged your kidneys are, known as the stage of CKD.

This can help your doctor decide the best treatment for you and determine how often you should have tests to monitor your condition.

Your eGFR result is given as a stage from one to five:
	•	stage 1 (G1) – a normal eGFR (above 90ml/min), but other tests have detected signs of kidney damage
	•	stage 2  (G2) – a slightly reduced eGFR (60-89ml/min), with other signs of kidney damage
	•	stage 3a (G3a) – an eGFR of 45-59ml/min
	•	stage 3b (G3b) – an eGFR of 30-44ml/min
	•	stage 4 (G4) – an eGFR of 15-29ml/min
	•	stage 5 (G5) – an eGFR below 15ml/min, meaning the kidneys have lost almost all of their function

Your ACR result is given as a stage from one to three:
	•	A1 – an ACR of less than 3mg/mmol
	•	A2 – an ACR of 3-30mg/mmol
	•	A3 – an ACR of more than 30mg/mmol
For both eGFR and ACR, a higher stage indicates more severe kidney disease.


TREATMENT
There's no cure for chronic kidney disease (CKD), but treatment can help relieve the symptoms and stop it getting worse.

Your treatment will depend on the stage of your CKD.
The main treatments are:
	•	lifestyle changes – to ensure you remain as healthy as possible
	•	medication – to control associated problems, such as high blood pressure and high cholesterol
	•	dialysis – treatment to replicate some of the kidney's functions, which may be necessary in advanced (stage 5) CKD
	•	kidney transplant – this may also be necessary in advanced (stage 5) CKD


LIFESTYLE CHANGES
The following lifestyle measures are usually recommended for people with kidney disease:
	•	stop smoking if you smoke
	•	eat a healthy, balanced diet
	•	restrict your salt intake to less than 6g (0.2oz) a day
	•	do regular exercise – aim to do at least 150 minutes a week
	•	moderate your alcohol intake so it's within the recommended limits of no more than 14 alcohol units a week
	•	lose weight if you're overweight or obese 
	•	avoid over-the-counter non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, except when advised to by a medical professional – these medicines can harm your kidneys if you have kidney disease


MEDICATION
There's no medicine specifically for CKD, but medication can help control many of the problems that cause the condition and complications that can occur as a result of it.

You may need to take medication to treat or prevent the different problems caused by CKD.

High blood pressure
Good control of blood pressure is vital to protect the kidneys.

People with kidney disease should usually aim to get their blood pressure down to below 140/90mmHg, but you should aim to get it down to below 130/80mmHg if you also have diabetes.

There are many types of blood pressure medication, but medicines called angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are often used. Examples include ramipril, enalapril and lisinopril.

Side effects of ACE inhibitors can include:
	•	a persistent dry cough
	•	dizziness
	•	tiredness or weakness 
	•	headaches

If the side effects of ACE inhibitors are particularly troublesome, you can be given a medication called an angiotensin-II receptor blocker (ARB) instead.

High cholesterol

People with CKD have a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, including heart attacks and strokes.

This is because some of the causes of kidney disease are the same as those for cardiovascular disease, including high blood pressure and high cholesterol.

You may be prescribed medication called statins to reduce your risk of developing cardiovascular disease. Examples include atorvastatin, fluvastatin and simvastatin.

Side effects of statins can include:
	•	headaches
	•	feeling sick
	•	constipation or diarrhoea
	•	muscle and joint pain

Water retention
You may experience swelling in your ankles, feet and hands if you have kidney disease.

This is because your kidneys aren't as effective at removing fluid from your blood, causing it to build up in the body tissues (oedema).

You may be advised to reduce your daily salt and fluid intake, including fluids in food like soups and yoghurts, to help relieve the swelling.

In some cases you may also be given water tablets (diuretics) to take, such as furosemide.

Side effects of diuretics can include dehydrationand reduced levels of sodium and potassium in the blood.

Anaemia
Many people with later-stage kidney disease develop anaemia, which is a lack of red blood cells.

Symptoms of anaemia include:
	•	tiredness 
	•	lack of energy
	•	shortness of breath
	•	a pounding, fluttering or irregular heartbeat (palpitations) 

If you experience anaemia, you may be given injections of a medication called erythropoietin. This is a hormone that helps your body produce more red blood cells.

If you have an iron deficiency as well, iron supplements may also be recommended.

Bone problems
If your kidneys are severely damaged, you can get a build-up of phosphate in your body because your kidneys cannot get rid of it.

Along with calcium, phosphate is important for maintaining healthy bones. But if your phosphate level rises too much, it can upset the balance of calcium in your body and lead to thinning of the bones.

You may be advised to limit the amount of high-phosphate food in your diet, such as red meat, dairy products, eggs and fish.

If this doesn't lower your phosphate level enough, you may be given medicines called phosphate binders. Commonly used medicines include calcium acetate and calcium carbonate.

Some people with kidney disease also have low levels of vitamin D, which is necessary for healthy bones, too.

If you're low in vitamin D, you may be given a supplement called colecalciferol or ergocalciferol to boost your vitamin D level. 

Glomerulonephritis
Kidney disease can be caused by inflammation of the filters inside the kidneys, known as glomerulonephritis.

In some cases this occurs as a result of the immune system mistakenly attacking the kidneys.

If a kidney biopsy finds that this is the cause of your kidney problems, you may be prescribed medicine to reduce the activity of your immune system, such as steroid medication or a medication called cyclophosphamide.


DIALYSIS
In a small proportion of people with kidney disease, the condition will eventually get to a point where their kidneys stop working.

This rarely happens suddenly, so there should be time to plan the next stage of your treatment.

One of the options when CKD reaches this stage is to have dialysis. This is a procedure to remove waste products and excess fluid from the blood.

There are two main types of dialysis:
	•	haemodialysis – this involves diverting blood into an external machine, where it's filtered before being returned to the body
	•	peritoneal dialysis – this involves pumping dialysis fluid into the space inside your tummy to draw out waste products from the blood passing through vessels lining the inside of your tummy

Haemodialysis is usually done about three times a week, either at hospital or at home. Peritoneal dialysis is normally done at home several times a day, or overnight.

If you don't have a kidney transplant, treatment with dialysis will usually need to be lifelong.

Talk to your doctor about the pros and cons of each type of dialysis and discuss which type you would prefer if your kidney function becomes severely reduced.


KIDNEY TRANSPLANT
An alternative to dialysis for people with severely reduced kidney function is a kidney transplant.

This is often the most effective treatment for advanced kidney disease, but it involves major surgery and taking medications to stop your body attacking the donor organ (immunosuppressants) for the rest of your life.

You can live with one kidney, which means donor kidneys can come from recently deceased or living donors. 

But there's still a shortage of donors, and sometimes you could wait months or years for a transplant.

You may need to have dialysis while you wait for a transplant.

Survival rates for kidney transplants are extremely good nowadays. About 90% of transplants still function after five years and many work usefully after 10 years or more.



SUPPORTIVE TREATMENT
You'll be offered supportive treatment if you decide not to have dialysis or a transplant for kidney failure, or they're not suitable for you. This is also called palliative or conservative care.

The aim is to treat and control the symptoms of kidney failure. It includes medical, psychological and practical care for both the person with kidney failure and their family, including discussion about how you feel and planning for the end of life.

Many people choose supportive treatment because they:
	•	are unlikely to benefit from or have a good quality of life with treatment
	•	don't want to go through the inconvenience of treatment with dialysis
	•	are advised against dialysis because they have other serious illnesses, and the negative aspects of treatment outweigh any likely benefits 
	•	have been on dialysis, but have decided to stop this treatment 
	•	are being treated with dialysis, but have another serious illness, such as severe heart disease or stroke, that will shorten their life

If you choose to have supportive treatment, your kidney unit will still look after you. Supportive care can still allow you to live for some time with a good quality of life.

Doctors and nurses will make sure you receive:
	•	medicines to protect your remaining kidney function for as long as possible 
	•	medicines to treat other symptoms of kidney failure, such as feeling out of breath, anaemia, loss of appetite or itchy skin 
	•	help to plan your home and money affairs 
	•	bereavement support for your family


LIVING WITH KIDNEY DISEASE
Most people can live a largely normal life with chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Although it's not possible to repair the damage that has already happened to your kidneys, your condition won't necessarily get worse. 

Kidney disease only reaches an advanced stage in a small proportion of people.

But even if your condition is mild, it's important to take good care of yourself to help stop it getting worse and reduce your risk of other health problems, such as cardiovascular disease.

Looking after yourself

Take your medication
It's very important that you take any prescribed medication, even if you don't feel unwell. Some medicines are designed to prevent serious problems occurring in the future.

It's also useful to read the information leaflet that comes with the medication about possible interactions with other medicines or supplements.

Check with your care team if you plan to take any over-the-counter remedies, such as painkillers or nutritional supplements. These can sometimes affect your kidneys or interfere with your medication.

Also speak to your care team if you have any concerns about the medication you are taking, or if you're experiencing any side effects.


Have a healthy diet
A healthy, balanced diet can help improve your general health and reduce your risk of developing further problems.

A balanced diet should include:
	•	plenty of fruit and vegetables – aim for at least five portions a day 
	•	meals based on starchy foods, such as potatoes, bread, rice or pasta
	•	some dairy or dairy alternatives
	•	some beans or pulses, fish, eggs, meat and other sources of protein
	•	low levels of saturated fat, salt and sugar
You may also be given advice about dietary changes that can specifically help with kidney disease, such as limiting the amount of potassium or phosphate in your diet.


Exercise regularly
Regular physical activity can also help improve your general health.

Don't be scared to exercise. Exercise is good for anyone with kidney disease, however severe. 

Not only will it boost your energy, help you sleep, strengthen your bones, ward off depression and keep you fit, it may also reduce your risk of problems such as heart disease.

If you have mild to moderate kidney disease, your ability to exercise shouldn't be reduced. You should be able to exercise as often and as vigorously as someone the same age as you with healthy kidneys.

If your condition is more advanced or you're already on dialysis, your ability to exercise is likely to be reduced, and you may become breathless and tired more quickly.

But don't be deterred – exercise is still beneficial. Make sure you start slowly and build up gradually. Check with your doctor before beginning a new exercise programme.


Stop smoking
If you smoke, stopping smoking can improve your overall health and reduce your risk of many other health problems.

Speak to your doctor if you think you'll need help quitting. They can provide support and, if necessary, prescribe stop smoking treatments.

Limit your alcohol consumption

You may still be able to drink alcohol if you have kidney disease, but it's advisable not to exceed the recommended limits of more than 14 alcohol units a week.

Speak to your doctor or care team if you find it difficult to cut down the amount of alcohol you drink.


Get vaccinated
Kidney disease can put a significant strain on your body and make you more vulnerable to infections.

Everyone with the condition is encouraged to have the annual flu jab and the one-off pneumococcal vaccination.

You can get these vaccinations at your GP surgery or a local pharmacy that offers a vaccination service.


Regular reviews and monitoring
You'll have regular contact with your care team to monitor your condition.

These appointments may involve:
	•	talking about your symptoms – such as whether they're affecting your normal activities or are getting worse
	•	a discussion about your medication – including whether you think you might be experiencing any side effects
	•	tests to monitor your kidney function and general health

It's also a good opportunity to ask any questions you have or raise any other issues you'd like to discuss with your care team.

You may also want to help monitor your condition at home – for example, by using a home blood pressure monitor.

Contact your doctor or care team if your symptoms are getting worse or you develop new symptoms.


Relationships and support
Coming to terms with a condition such as kidney disease can put a strain on you, your family and your friends. It can be difficult to talk to people about your condition, even if they're close to you.

Learning about kidney disease often helps because you and your family will understand more about what to expect and feel more in control of the illness, instead of feeling that your lives are now dominated by kidney disease and its treatment.

Be open about how you feel, and let your family and friends know what they can do to help. However, do not feel shy about telling them that you need some time to yourself, if that is what you need.

Get support
Your doctor or care team can reassure you if you have questions about your kidney disease, or you may find it helpful to talk to a trained counsellor, psychologist or specialist telephone helpline operator. Your surgeon will have information on these.

Some people find it helpful to talk to other people with kidney disease at a local support group or through an internet chat room.

Sex and pregnancy
Sex
Having kidney disease can affect your sexual relationships. Some couples become closer after a diagnosis of kidney disease, while others find their loved ones are affected by worries about how they'll cope with the effects of the illness.
Both men and women may experience issues about body image and self-esteem, and this can affect the relationship.
Problems such as erectile dysfunction and reduced sex drive are also fairly common in people with kidney disease.
Try to share your feelings with your partner. If you have problems with sex that do not get better with time, speak to your care team. Treatment and support is available.

Pregnancy
If you have mild to moderate kidney disease, it's unlikely your condition or its treatment will affect your chances of having children.
More advanced kidney disease may affect women's periods and reduce a man's sperm count, which can make it more difficult to get pregnant, although this doesn't mean you won't be able to have a child.
It's important to use contraception if you don't want to get pregnant.
If you do want to try for a baby, it's a good idea to speak to your care team for advice first. There may be risks to mother and baby, and changes to your treatment or check-ups may be necessary.

Prevention
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) can't always be prevented, but you can take steps to reduce the chances of getting the condition.
Following the advice below can reduce your risk.

Manage underlying conditions
If you have a long-term condition that could potentially lead to kidney disease, such as diabetes or high blood pressure, it's important this is managed carefully.
Follow the advice of your doctor, take any medication you're prescribed and keep all appointments relating to your condition.

Stop smoking
Smoking increases your risk of cardiovascular disease, including heart attacks or strokes, which is associated with a higher risk of kidney disease.
Stopping smoking will improve your general health and reduce your risk of these serious conditions.
Healthy diet
A balanced diet can reduce your risk of kidney disease by keeping your blood pressure and cholesterol at a healthy level.
A balanced diet should include:
	•	plenty of fruit and vegetables – aim for at least five portions a day 
	•	meals based on starchy foods – such as potatoes, bread, rice or pasta
	•	some dairy or dairy alternatives
	•	some beans or pulses, fish, eggs, meat and other sources of protein
	•	low levels of saturated fat, salt and sugar
You should also limit the amount of salt in your diet to no more than 6g (0.2oz) a day. Too much salt can increase your blood pressure.
Read more about salt in your diet.

Cut down on alcohol
Drinking excessive amounts of alcohol can cause your blood pressure and cholesterol levels to rise to unhealthy levels.
Sticking to the recommended alcohol limits is the best way to reduce your risk:
	•	men and women are advised not to regularly drink more than 14 units a week
	•	spread your drinking over three days or more if you drink as much as 14 units a week
Fourteen units is equivalent to six pints of average-strength beer or 10 small glasses of low-strength wine.

Exercise regularly
Regular exercise should help lower your blood pressure and reduce your risk of developing kidney disease.
At least 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) of moderate-intensity aerobic activity such as cycling or fast walking every week is recommended. 

Be careful with painkillers
Kidney disease can be caused by taking too many non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs), such as aspirin and ibuprofen, or taking them for longer than recommended.
If you need to take painkillers, make sure you follow the instructions that come with the medication.",2018-07-08T21:24:04.291Z
"Symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, and everything you need to know about measles.",MEASLES,information2,putiancuarterocam19@gmail.com,"OVERVIEW
Measles is a highly infectious viral illness that can be very unpleasant and sometimes lead to serious complications.

Anyone can get measles if they haven't been vaccinated or they haven't had it before, although it's most common in young children.
The infection usually clears in around 7 to 10 days.

SYMPTOMS
The initial symptoms of measles develop around 10 days after you're infected.
These can include:
	•	cold-like symptoms, such as a runny nose, sneezing, and a cough
	•	sore, red eyes that may be sensitive to light
	•	a high temperature (fever), which may reach around 40C (104F)
	•	small grayish-white spots on the inside of the cheeks

A few days later, a red-brown spotted rash will appear. This usually starts on the head or upper neck, before spreading outwards to the rest of the body.


WHEN TO SEE YOUR DOCTOR
You should contact your doctor as soon as possible if you suspect that you or your child may have measles.

It's best to phone before your visit as your surgeon may need to make arrangements to reduce the risk of spreading the infection to others.

You should also see your doctor if you've been in close contact with someone who has measles and you've not been fully vaccinated (had two doses of the MMR vaccine) or haven't had the infection before – even if you don't have any symptoms.


IS MEASLES SERIOUS?
Measles can be unpleasant, but will usually pass in about 7 to 10 days without causing any further problems.

Once you've had measles, your body builds up resistance (immunity) to the virus and it's highly unlikely you'll get it again.

However, measles can lead to serious and potentially life-threatening complications in some people. These include infections of the lungs (pneumonia) and brain (encephalitis).


HOW MEASLES IS SPREAD
The measles virus is contained in the millions of tiny droplets that come out of the nose and mouth when an infected person coughs or sneezes.

You can easily catch measles by breathing in these droplets or, if the droplets have settled on a surface, by touching the surface and then placing your hands near your nose or mouth. The virus can survive on surfaces for a few hours.

People with measles are infectious from when the symptoms develop until about four days after the rash first appears.


HOW MEASLES CAN BE PREVENTED
Measles can be prevented by having the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine.

This is given in two doses as part of the NHS childhood vaccination programme. 
The first dose is given when your child is around 13 months old and a second dose is given before your child starts school.

Adults and older children can be vaccinated at any age if they haven't been fully vaccinated before. Ask your doctor about having the vaccination.

If the MMR vaccine isn't suitable for you, a treatment called human normal immunoglobulin (HNIG) can be used if you're at immediate risk of catching measles.

Read more about preventing measles.


TREATING MEASLES
There are several things you can do to help relieve your symptoms and reduce the risk of spreading the infection, including:
	•	taking paracetamol or ibuprofen to relieve fever, aches and pains – aspirin should not be given to children under 16 years old
	•	drinking plenty of water to avoid dehydration
	•	closing the curtains to help reduce light sensitivity
	•	using soaked cotton wool to clean the eyes
	•	staying off school or work for at least four days from when the rash first appears

In severe cases, especially if there are complications, you or your child may need to be admitted to hospital for treatment.


HOW  COMMON IS MEASLES
Measles is common in many countries around the world and there are currently several large measles outbreaks across Europe.

In 2016 there were over 500 measles cases in England, many in teenagers and young people attending summer festivals who had missed out on their MMR vaccine in childhood.


SYMPTOMS
Measles starts with cold-like symptoms that develop about 10 days after becoming infected. This is followed a few days later by the measles rash.

For most people, the illness lasts around 7 to 10 days in total.

Initial symptoms
The initial symptoms of measles can include:
	•	a runny or blocked nose
	•	sneezing
	•	watery eyes
	•	swollen eyelids
	•	sore, red eyes that may be sensitive to light
	•	a high temperature (fever), which may reach around 40C (104F)
	•	small grayish-white spots in the mouth (see below)
	•	aches and pains
	•	a cough
	•	loss of appetite
	•	tiredness, irritability and a general lack of energy


Spots in the mouth
A day or two before the rash appears, many people with measles develop small grayish-white spots in their mouth.

Not everyone with measles has these spots, but if someone has them in addition to the other symptoms listed above or a rash, it's highly likely they have the condition.

The spots will usually last for a few days.


The measles rash
The measles rash appears around 2 to 4 days after the initial symptoms and normally fades after about a week.

You'll usually feel most ill on the first or second day after the rash develops.
The rash:
	•	is made up of small red-brown, flat or slightly raised spots that may join together into larger blotchy patches
	•	usually first appears on the head or neck, before spreading outwards to the rest of the body
	•	is slightly itchy for some people
	•	can look similar to other childhood conditions, such as slapped cheek syndrome, roseola or rubella
	•	is unlikely to be caused by measles if the person has been fully vaccinated (had 2 doses of the MMR vaccine) or had measles before


WHEN TO SEEK MEDICAL ADVICE
Contact your doctor as soon as possible if you suspect that you or your child has measles, even if you're not completely sure.

It's best to phone before your visit, as your doctor for surgery may need to make arrangements to reduce the risk of spreading the infection to others.

You should also see your doctor if you've been in close contact with someone who has measles and you've not been fully vaccinated or haven't had the infection before – even if you don't have any symptoms yet.


TREATMENT
There's no specific treatment for measles, but the condition usually improves within 7 to 10 days. Your doctor will probably suggest taking things easy at home until you're feeling better.

Stay away from work or school for at least four days from when the measles rash first appears to reduce the risk of spreading the infection.

You should also try to avoid contact with people who are more vulnerable to the infection, such as young children and pregnant women.

Relieving symptoms
If the symptoms of measles are causing discomfort for you or your child, there are some things you can do to treat these while you wait for your body to fight off the virus.

Controlling fever and relieving pain
Paracetamol or ibuprofen can be used to reduce a high temperature (fever) and relieve any aches or pains if your child is uncomfortable.
Liquid infant paracetamol can be used for young children. Aspirin should not be given to children under 16 years old.
Speak to your pharmacist if you're not sure which medications are suitable for your child.

Drink plenty of fluids
If your child has a high temperature, make sure they drink plenty of fluids as they may be at risk of dehydration.
Keeping hydrated may also help reduce throat discomfort caused by coughing.

Treating sore eyes
You can gently clean away any dry, scaling skin from your child's eyelids and lashes using cotton wool soaked in water.
Closing curtains or dimming lights can help if bright light is hurting their eyes.

Treating cold-like symptoms
If your child has cold-like symptoms, such as a runny nose or a cough, there are a number of things you can do to help them feel more comfortable.
For example, it might help your child if they sit in a hot, steamy bathroom. Or you could put a wet towel on a warm radiator to moisten the air, which may help ease your child's cough.
Drinking warm drinks, particularly ones containing lemon or honey, may also help to relax the airways, loosen mucus, and soothe a cough. Honey should not be given to babies under 12 months.


SPOTTING SIGNS OF SERIOUS ILLNESS
If you or your child has measles, you should keep an eye out for any signs of the serious complications that can sometimes develop.

Signs of a more serious problem include:
	•	shortness of breath
	•	a sharp chest pain that feels worse with breathing
	•	coughing up blood
	•	drowsiness
	•	confusion
	•	convulsions
Go to the nearest hospital if you or your child develop any of these symptoms.

Complications
Most people will recover from measles after around 7 to 10 days, but sometimes it can lead to serious complications.
It's estimated around 1 in every 5,000 people with measles will die as a result of the infection.


WHO'S MOST AT RISK?
Complications of measles are more likely to develop in certain groups of people, including:
	•	babies younger than one year old
	•	children with a poor diet
	•	children with a weakened immune system, such as those with leukaemia
	•	teenagers and adults

Children who are older than one year and otherwise healthy have the lowest risk of developing complications.

Common complications
More common complications of measles include:
	•	diarrhea and vomiting, which can lead to dehydration
	•	middle ear infection (otitis media), which can cause earache
	•	eye infection (conjunctivitis)
	•	inflammation of the voice box (laryngitis)
	•	pneumonia, bronchitis and croup – infections of the airways and lungs
	•	convulsion caused by a fever (febrile seizures)
About 1 in every 15 children with measles will develop complications like these.

Uncommon complications
Less common complications of measles include:
	•	liver infection (hepatitis)
	•	misalignment of the eyes – if the virus affects the nerves and muscles of the eye
	•	infection of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord (meningitis) or infection of the brain itself (encephalitis)

Rare complications
In rare cases, measles can lead to:
	•	serious eye disorders, such as an infection of the optic nerve, the nerve that transmits information from the eye to the brain – this is known as optic neuritis and can lead to vision loss 
	•	heart and nervous system problems
	•	a fatal brain complication known as subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), which can occur several years after measles – this is very rare, occurring in only 1 in every 25,000 cases

Pregnancy complications
If you're not immune to measles and you become infected while you're pregnant, there's a risk of:
	•	miscarriage or stillbirth
	•	your baby being born prematurely – before the 37th week of pregnancy
	•	your baby having a low birth weight
If you're pregnant and you think you've come into contact with someone with measles and you know you're not immune, you should see your doctor as soon as possible. They can advise you about treatment to reduce your risk of developing the condition.


When to seek immediate medical advice
Go to the nearest hospital if you or your child have measles and develop:
	•	shortness of breath
	•	a sharp chest pain that feels worse with breathing
	•	coughing up blood
	•	drowsiness
	•	confusion
	•	convulsions
These symptoms may be a sign of a serious bacterial infection requiring admission to hospital and treatment with antibiotics.


PREVENTION
You can avoid catching measles by having the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine.
If the MMR vaccine isn't suitable for you, a treatment called human normal immunoglobulin (HNIG) can be used if you're at immediate risk of catching measles.

MMR vaccine
Routine vaccination
The MMR vaccine is given as part of the routine NHS childhood vaccination programme. One dose is usually given to a child when they're 12-13 months old and a second dose is given before they start school, usually between three and five years old.
Contact your doctor if you are uncertain about whether your child's vaccinations are up-to-date.
You or your child can be vaccinated at any point if you haven't been fully vaccinated before. If you're not sure whether you were vaccinated in the past, having the vaccine again won't cause any harm.
Special circumstances
A dose of the MMR vaccine can also be given to anyone over six months of age if they're at an immediate risk of catching measles. For example, this could be if:
	•	there's an outbreak of measles in your local area
	•	you've been in close contact with someone who has measles
	•	you're planning on traveling to an area where the infection is widespread
Children who have the vaccine before their first birthday should still have the two routine doses at around 13 months of age and before they start school.

Human normal immunoglobulin
Human normal immunoglobulin (HNIG) is a special concentration of antibodies that can give short-term but immediate protection against measles.
It may be recommended for people in the following groups if they've been exposed to someone with measles:
	•	babies under six months of age
	•	pregnant women who haven't been fully vaccinated or haven't had measles before
	•	people with weak immune systems – for example, those with HIV or people receiving treatment that weakens their immune system, such as treatment for leukaemia
HNIG should ideally be given within six days of exposure.

Stopping measles spreading to others
If you already have measles, it's important to reduce the risk of spreading the infection to other people.
You should:
	•	avoid work or school for at least four days from when you first developed the measles rash
	•	try to avoid contact with people who are more vulnerable to the infection, such as young children and pregnant women, while you're ill",2018-07-08T21:30:07.957Z
"Symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, and everything you need to know about rabies.",RABIES,information2,putiancuarterocam19@gmail.com,"OVERVIEW
Rabies is a rare but very serious infection of the brain and nerves. It's usually caught from the bite or scratch of an infected animal, most often a dog.

Rabies is found throughout the world, particularly in Asia, Africa and Central and South America. It's not found in the UK except in a small number of wild bats.

It's almost always fatal once symptoms appear, but treatment before this happens is very effective. There's also a vaccine for people at risk of being infected.

RABIES VACCINATION
You should consider getting vaccinated against rabies if:
	•	you're traveling to an area where rabies is common and you plan to stay for a month or more or there's unlikely to be quick access to appropriate medical care
	•	you're traveling to an area where rabies is common and you plan to do activities that could put you at increased risk of exposure to animals with rabies, such as running or cycling

Visit your doctor or a travel clinic if you think you may need the vaccine. It's sometimes free, but most people have to pay.

Even if you've been vaccinated, you should still take precautions to avoid coming into contact with rabies if you're traveling in an area where rabies is found and get medical advice straight away if you've been bitten or scratched.

A few people may need the rabies vaccine because they could come into contact with rabies through their work. If you think this applies to you, speak to your occupational health department.


HOW TO AVOID BEING BITTEN OR GETTING SCRATCHED
All mammals (including monkeys) can carry rabies, but it's most common in:
	•	dogs
	•	bats
	•	raccoons
	•	foxes
	•	jackals
	•	cats
	•	mongooses

They can spread the infection if they bite or scratch you, or in rare cases if they lick an open wound or their saliva gets into your mouth or eyes. Rabies isn't spread through unbroken skin or between people.

While traveling in an area where rabies is a risk:
	•	avoid contact with animals – some infected animals may behave strangely, but sometimes there may be no obvious signs they're infected
	•	avoid touching any dead animals

If you're traveling with a child, make sure they're aware of the dangers and that they should tell you if they've been bitten, scratched or licked by an animal. 

Check them for any wounds if they come into contact with an animal.


WHAT TO DO IF YOU'VE BEEN BITEN OR SCRATCHED
If you've been bitten or scratched by an animal in an area with a risk of rabies:
	•	immediately clean the wound with running water and soap for several minutes
	•	disinfect the wound with an alcohol- or iodine-based disinfectant and apply a simple dressing, if possible
	•	go to the nearest medical centre, hospital or surgeon as soon as possible and explain that you've been bitten or scratched

If this happens while you're abroad, get local medical help immediately. It's still a good idea to get help – even if it's been several weeks since you were bitten or scratched.

It's unlikely that you've been infected, but it's best to be safe. Post-exposure treatment is nearly 100% effective if it's started before any symptoms of rabies appear.


TREATMENT AFTER A BITE OR SCRATCH
If you've been bitten, scratched or licked by an animal that might have rabies, you may need specialist medical treatment to stop you getting rabies. This is called post-exposure treatment.

Post-exposure treatment involves:
	•	cleaning and disinfecting the wound
	•	a course of the rabies vaccine – you'll need to have five doses over a month if you haven't been vaccinated before, or two doses a few days apart if you have
	•	in some cases, a medicine called immunoglobulin given into and around the wound – this provides immediate but short-term protection if there's a significant chance you've been infected

Treatment should be started as soon as possible, ideally within a few hours of being bitten or scratched.

But it's often safe to delay treatment until the next day if the vaccine and/or immunoglobulin need to be specially ordered in by your doctor.


SYMPTOMS
Without treatment, the symptoms of rabies will usually develop after 3-12 weeks, although they can start sooner or much later than this.

The first symptoms can include:
	•	a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above
	•	a headache
	•	feeling anxious or generally unwell
	•	in some cases, discomfort at the site of the bite.

Other symptoms appear a few days later, such as:
	•	confusion or aggressive behavior
	•	seeing or hearing things (hallucinations)
	•	producing lots of saliva or frothing at the mouth
	•	muscle spasms
	•	difficulty swallowing and breathing
	•	inability to move (paralysis)

Once symptoms appear, rabies is almost always fatal. In these cases, treatment will focus on making the person as comfortable as possible.


VACCINATION
A vaccine is available to help protect people at risk of being exposed to rabies.
But even if you've been vaccinated, you should get urgent medical help if you're bitten or scratched by an animal that may have had rabies.


WHO SHOULD HAVE THE RABIES VACCINE

Travellers
You should consider getting vaccinated against rabies if:
	•	you're traveling to an area where rabies is common and you plan to stay for a month or more or there's unlikely to be quick access to appropriate medical care
	•	you're traveling to an area where rabies is common and you plan to do activities that could put you at increased risk of exposure to animals with rabies, such as running or cycling

It takes three to four weeks to complete the vaccine course, so you ideally need to start it at least a month before you plan to leave.

Pregnant women are advised to have the rabies vaccine if the risk of exposure to rabies is thought to be high and there's limited access to medical care.


People at risk through their work
Vaccination is also recommended for anyone at risk of being exposed to rabies through their job, such as:
	•	people who regularly handle bats
	•	people who handle imported animals – such as workers at zoos or animal quarantine centers
	•	laboratory workers who handle rabies samples

If you think this applies to you, speak to your occupational health department.


WHERE TO GET THE RABIES VACCINE
Your local surgeon may be able to give you the rabies vaccination, although you may need to pay for it. Alternatively, you can pay for the vaccine at a private travel vaccination clinic.

Will I have to pay for the rabies vaccine?
You will usually have to pay for the rabies vaccine if you need it for protection while traveling.

The vaccine involves three doses. If you need the vaccine because there's a risk you could be exposed to the infection through your job, you might be able to have it for free. Ask your employer or occupational health department about this.


HOW THE RABIES VACCINE IS GIVEN
The rabies vaccination is given as injections into your upper arm.

You'll need three doses of the vaccine. The second dose is given seven days after the first. The third dose is given 14 or 21 days after the second.

If you're planning to travel to an area where rabies is found, you should complete the full course of three doses before your departure.


BOOSTER DOSES
If you've been vaccinated against rabies before but you continue to be at risk (for example, through your job), you may need further ""booster"" doses to ensure you stay protected.

Speak to your occupational health department about this.

For travelers, a booster dose may be considered if you were first vaccinated 10 or more years ago and you're traveling to a high-risk area again.


SIDE EFFECTS OF THE RABIES VACCINE
After having the rabies vaccine, some people have temporary soreness, redness and swelling at the injection site for 24-48 hours.

In rare cases, some people also experience:
	•	a mild high temperature (fever)
	•	a headache
	•	muscle aches
	•	vomiting
	•	a rash

The vaccines used in the UK contain dead (inactive) rabies virus, so you can't catch rabies by being vaccinated.",2018-07-09T03:15:41.693Z
"Symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, and everything you need to know about tuberculosis. ",TUBERCULOSIS,information2,putiancuarterocam19@gmail.com,"OVERVIEW
Tuberculosis (TB) is a bacterial infection spread through inhaling tiny droplets from the coughs or sneezes of an infected person.

It mainly affects the lungs, but it can affect any part of the body, including the stomach (abdomen) glands, bones and nervous system.

TB is a serious condition, but it can be cured if it's treated with the right antibiotics.


SYMPTOMS OF TB
Typical symptoms of TB include:
	•	a persistent cough that lasts more than three weeks and usually brings up phlegm, which may contain blood
	•	weight loss
	•	night sweats
	•	high temperature (fever)
	•	tiredness and fatigue
	•	loss of appetite
	•	swellings in the neck

You should see a doctor if you have a cough that lasts more than three weeks or you cough up blood.

Read more about the symptoms of TB and diagnosing TB.


WHAT CAUSES TB?
TB is a bacterial infection. TB that affects the lungs (pulmonary TB) is the most contagious type, but it usually only spreads after prolonged exposure to someone with the illness. 

In most healthy people, the body's natural defense against infection and illness (the immune system) kills the bacteria and there are no symptoms.
Sometimes the immune system can't kill the bacteria, but manages to prevent it spreading in the body.

You won't have any symptoms, but the bacteria will remain in your body. This is known as latent TB. People with latent TB aren't infectious to others.

If the immune system fails to kill or contain the infection, it can spread within the lungs or other parts of the body and symptoms will develop within a few weeks or months. This is known as active TB.

Latent TB could develop into an active TB disease at a later date, particularly if your immune system becomes weakened.


TREATING TB
With treatment, TB can almost always be cured. A course of antibiotics will usually need to be taken for six months.

Several different antibiotics are used because some forms of TB are resistant to certain antibiotics.

If you're infected with a drug-resistant form of TB, treatment with six or more different medications may be needed.

If you're diagnosed with pulmonary TB, you'll be contagious for about two to three weeks into your course of treatment.

You won't usually need to be isolated during this time, but it's important to take some basic precautions to stop the infection spreading to your family and friends.

You should:
	•	stay away from work, school or college until your TB treatment team advises you it's safe to return
	•	always cover your mouth when coughing, sneezing or laughing
	•	carefully dispose of any used tissues in a sealed plastic bag
	•	open windows when possible to ensure a good supply of fresh air in the areas where you spend time
	•	avoid sleeping in the same room as other people 

If you're in close contact with someone who has TB, you may have tests to see whether you're also infected. These can include a chest X-ray, blood tests, and a skin test called the Mantoux test.


VACCINATION FOR TB
The BCG vaccine offers protection against TB, and is recommended on the NHS for babies, children and adults under the age of 35 who are considered to be at risk of catching TB.

The BCG vaccine isn't routinely given to anyone over the age of 35 as there's no evidence that it works for people in this age group.

At-risk groups include:
	•	children living in areas with high rates of TB
	•	people with close family members from countries with high TB rates
	•	people going to live and work with local people for more than three months in an area with high rates of TB

If you're a healthcare worker or NHS employee and you come into contact with patients or clinical specimens, you should also have a TB vaccination, irrespective of age, if:
	•	you haven't been previously vaccinated (you don't have a BCG scar or the relevant documentation), and
	•	the results of a Mantoux skin test or a TB interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) blood test are negative


COUNTRIES WITH HIGH TB RATES
Parts of the world with high rates of TB include:
	•	Africa – particularly sub-Saharan Africa (all the African countries south of the Sahara desert) and west Africa
	•	southeast Asia – including India, Pakistan, Indonesia and Bangladesh
	•	Russia
	•	China
	•	South America
	•	the western Pacific region (to the west of the Pacific Ocean) – including Vietnam, Cambodia and the Philippines 

The World Health Organization (WHO) has produced a world map showing countries with high rates of TB.


SYMPTOMS
The symptoms of tuberculosis (TB) vary depending on which part of the body is affected.

TB disease usually develops slowly, and it may take several weeks for you to become aware that you're ill.

Your symptoms might not begin until months or even years after you were initially infected.

Sometimes the infection doesn't cause any symptoms. This is known as latent TB.

It's called active TB if you have symptoms. However, in some cases, symptoms might not develop until months or even years after the initial infection.

Contact your doctor if you or your child have symptoms of TB.

General symptoms of TB
	•	lack of appetite and weight loss
	•	a high temperature (fever)
	•	night sweats
	•	extreme tiredness or fatigue

These symptoms can have many different causes, however, and aren't always a sign of TB.

TB that affects the lungs (pulmonary TB)
Most TB infections affect the lungs, which can cause:
	•	a persistent cough that lasts more than three weeks and usually brings up phlegm, which may contain blood

	•	breathlessness that gradually gets worse

TB OUTSIDE THE LUNGS
Less commonly, TB infections develop in areas outside the lungs, such as the small glands that form part of the immune system (the lymph nodes), the bones and joints, the digestive system, the bladder and reproductive system, and the brain and nerves (the nervous system).

Symptoms can include:
	•	persistently swollen glands
	•	abdominal pain
	•	pain and loss of movement in an affected bone or joint
	•	confusion
	•	a persistent headache
	•	Seizures

TB affecting other parts of the body is more common in people who have a weakened immune system.


CAUSES
Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by a type of bacterium called Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

It's spread when a person with active TB disease in their lungs coughs or sneezes and someone else inhales the expelled droplets, which contain TB bacteria.

Although TB is spread in a similar way to a cold or the flu, it isn't as contagious.
You would have to spend prolonged periods (several hours) in close contact with an infected person to catch the infection yourself.

For example, TB infections usually spread between family members who live in the same house. It would be highly unlikely for you to become infected by sitting next to an infected person on a bus or train.

Not everyone with TB is infectious. Children with TB or people with a TB infection that occurs outside the lungs (extrapulmonary TB)don't spread the infection.


LATENT OR ACTIVE TB
In most healthy people, the immune system is able to destroy the bacteria that cause TB.

But in some cases, the bacteria infect the body but don't cause any symptoms (latent TB), or the infection begins to cause symptoms within weeks, months or even years (active TB).

Up to 10% of people with latent TB eventually develop active TB years after the initial infection.

This usually happens either within the first year or two of infection, or when the immune system is weakened – for example, if someone is having chemotherapy treatment for cancer.


WHO'S MOST AT RISK?
Anyone can get TB, but those at greatest risk include people:
	•	who live in, come from, or have spent time in a country or area with high levels of TB 
	•	in prolonged close contact with someone who's infected
	•	living in crowded conditions
	•	with a condition that weakens their immune system, such as HIV
	•	having treatments that weaken the immune system, such as chemotherapy or biological agents 
	•	who are very young or very old – the immune systems of people who are young or elderly tend to be weaker than those of healthy adults
	•	in poor health or with a poor diet because of lifestyle and other problems, such as drug misuse, alcohol misuse, or homelessness


DIAGNOSIS
Several tests are used to diagnose tuberculosis (TB), depending on the type of TB suspected.
Your doctor may refer you to a TB specialist for testing and treatment if they think you have TB.

Pulmonary TB
Diagnosing pulmonary TB – TB that affects the lungs – can be difficult, and several tests are usually needed.
You may have a chest X-ray to look for changes in the appearance of your lungs that are suggestive of TB. Samples of phlegm will also often be taken and checked for the presence of TB bacteria.
These tests are important in helping to decide the most effective treatment for you.

EXTRAPULMONARY TB
Several tests can be used to confirm a diagnosis of suspected extrapulmonary TB, which is TB that occurs outside the lungs.

These tests include:
	•	a CT scan, MRI scan or ultrasound scan of the affected part of the body
	•	an examination of the inside of your body using a long, thin, flexible tube with a light and camera at one end (endoscopy) – the endoscope can be inserted through a natural opening, such as your mouth, or through a small cut made in your skin (laparoscopy) if there's a need to check other parts of your body
	•	urine and blood tests
	•	a biopsy – a small sample of tissue or fluid is taken from the affected area and tested for TB bacteria

You may also have a lumbar puncture, where a small sample of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is taken from the base of your spine. CSF is fluid that surrounds the brain.

The sample can be checked to see whether TB has infected your brain and spinal cord (central nervous system).


TESTING FOR LATENT TB
In some circumstances, you may need to have a test to check for latent TB – where you've been infected with TB bacteria, but don't have any symptoms.

For example, you may need to have a test if you've been in close contact with someone known to have active TB disease involving the lungs, or if you've recently spent time in a country where TB levels are high.


MANTOUX TEST
The Mantoux test is a widely used test for latent TB. It involves injecting a small amount of a substance called PPD tuberculin into the skin of your forearm. It's also called the tuberculin skin test (TST).

If you have a latent TB infection, your skin will be sensitive to PPD tuberculin and a small, hard red bump will develop at the site of the injection, usually within 48 to 72 hours of having the test.

If you have a very strong skin reaction, you may need a chest X-ray to confirm whether you have active TB disease.

If you don't have a latent infection, your skin won't react to the Mantoux test. However, as TB can take a long time to develop, you may need to be screened again at a later stage.

If you've had the BCG vaccination, you may have a mild skin reaction to the Mantoux test. This doesn't necessarily mean you have latent TB.


INTERFERON GAMMA RELEASE ASSAY (IGRA)
The interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) is a blood test for TB that's becoming more widely available.

The IGRA may be used to help diagnose latent TB:
	•	if you have a positive Mantoux test
	•	if you previously had the BCG vaccination – the Mantoux test may not be reliable in these cases
	•	as part of your TB screening if you've just came from a country where TB is common
	•	as part of a health check when you register with a doctor
	•	if you're about to have treatment that will suppress your immune system
	•	if you're a healthcare worker


TREATMENT
Treatment for tuberculosis (TB) usually involves taking antibiotics for several months.

While TB is a serious condition that can be fatal if left untreated, deaths are rare if treatment is completed.

Most people don't need to be admitted to hospital during treatment.


PULMONARY TB
You'll be prescribed at least a six-month course of a combination of antibiotics if you're diagnosed with active pulmonary TB, where your lungs are affected and you have symptoms.

The usual treatment is:
	•	two antibiotics (isoniazid and rifampicin) for six months
	•	two additional antibiotics (pyrazinamide and ethambutol) for the first two months of the six-month treatment period 

It may be several weeks before you start to feel better. The exact length of time will depend on your overall health and the severity of your TB.
After taking antibiotics for two weeks, most people are no longer infectious and feel better.

However, it's important to continue taking your medicine exactly as prescribed and to complete the whole course of antibiotics.
Taking medication for six months is the best way to ensure the TB bacteria are killed.

If you stop taking your antibiotics before you complete the course or you skip a dose, the TB infection may become resistant to the antibiotics.

This is potentially serious because it can be difficult to treat and will require a longer course of treatment with different, and possibly more toxic, therapies.

If you find it difficult to take your medication every day, your treatment team can work with you to find a solution.

This may include having regular contact with your treatment team at home, at the treatment clinic, or somewhere else that's more convenient.

If treatment is completed correctly, you shouldn't need any further checks by a TB specialist afterwards. You may be given advice about spotting signs that the illness has returned, although this is rare.


EXTRAPULMONARY TB
Extrapulmonary TB – TB that occurs outside the lungs – can be treated using the same combination of antibiotics as those used to treat pulmonary TB.

If you have TB in areas like your brain or the sac surrounding your heart (pericardium), you may initially be prescribed a corticosteroid such as prednisolone for several weeks to take at the same time as your antibiotics. This will help reduce any swelling in the affected areas.

As with pulmonary TB, it's important to take your medicines exactly as prescribed and to finish the whole course.


LATENT TB
Latent TB is where you've been infected with the TB bacteria, but don't have any symptoms of active infection.

If you have latent TB and are aged 65 or under, treatment is usually recommended. However, the antibiotics used to treat TB can cause liver damage in older adults. 

If liver damage is a concern and you're aged between 35 and 65, your TB team will discuss with you the advantages and disadvantages of taking treatment for latent TB.

Latent TB is also not always treated if it's thought to be drug resistant. If this is the case, you may be regularly monitored to check the infection doesn't become active.

In some cases, testing and treatment for latent TB may be recommended for people who require treatment that will weaken their immune system, such as long-term corticosteroids, chemotherapy or biological inhibitors like TNF inhibitors. This is because there's a risk of the infection becoming active.

Treatment for latent TB generally involves:
	•	either taking a combination of rifampicin and isoniazid for three months,
	•	or isoniazid on its own for six months


SIDE EFFECTS OF TREATMENT
Isoniazid can cause nerve damage (peripheral neuropathy). You'll be given supplements of vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) to take alongside it to reduce this risk. 

Your liver function will be tested before you start treatment.

In rare cases, the antibiotics used to treat TB can cause eye damage, which can be serious. If you're going to be treated with ethambutol, your vision should also be tested at the beginning of the course of treatment.

Contact your TB treatment team if you develop any worrying symptoms during treatment, such as:
	•	being sick 
	•	yellowing of your skin and the whites of your eyes (jaundice)
	•	an unexplained high temperature (fever)
	•	tingling or numbness in your hands or feet
	•	a rash or itchy skin
	•	changes to your vision, such as blurred vision

Rifampicin can reduce the effectiveness of some types of contraception, such as the combined contraceptive pill. You should use an alternative method of contraception, such as condoms, while taking rifampicin.

Rifampicin can also interact with other medication, so it's important that your TB team know about all of the medicine you're taking before you start treatment for TB.


PREVENTING THE SPREAD OF INFECTION
If you're diagnosed with pulmonary TB, you'll be contagious up to about two to three weeks into your course of treatment.

You won't usually need to be isolated during this time, but it's important to take some basic precautions to stop TB spreading to your family and friends.

You should:
	•	stay away from work, school or college until your TB treatment team advises you it's safe to return 
	•	always cover your mouth – preferably with a disposable tissue – when coughing, sneezing or laughing
	•	carefully dispose of any used tissues in a sealed plastic bag 
	•	open windows when possible to ensure a good supply of fresh air in the areas where you spend time
	•	not sleep in the same room as other people – you could cough or sneeze in your sleep without realizing it


WHAT IF SOMEONE I KNOW HAS TB?
When someone is diagnosed with TB, their treatment team will assess whether other people are at risk of infection.

This may include close contacts, such as people living with the person who has TB, as well as casual contacts, such as work colleagues and social contacts.

Anyone who's thought to be at risk will be asked to go for testing, and will be given advice and any necessary treatment after their results.

Your guide to knowing the how HIV is transmitted and prevented.,"HIV–TRANSMISSION, STAGES, AND PREVENTION",information2,putiancuarterocam19@gmail.com,"WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT STAGES OF HIV?

1. HIV Infection
	✓	HIV is introduced into the body and starts to multiply and spread.

2. Window Period
	✓	The time between the infection and when the body begins to make detectable antibodies. The infected person experiences mild cold, night sweats, etc. This lasts 3-6 months.

3. Seroconversion
	✓	The time when a person’s blood starts developing antibodies to help fight the HIV infection. It occurs approximately 6-12 weeks after HIV infection.

4. Asymptomatic Phase
	✓	The period in which a PLHIV will test positive for HIV, but does not have any signs/symptoms of the disease yet.

5. Symptomatic Phase
	✓	PLHIV begins to show signs and symptoms.
	✓	HIV-Related Symptoms increase due to an increase in the amount of HIV virus in the body and the destruction of CD4+ cells and other important immune system functions.
	✓	During this period people begin to develop increasing opportunistic infections. Mild mouth sores, skin infection and night sweats.

6. AIDS Stage
	✓	Life-threatening or “terminal-stage” of HIV infection. The PLHIV’s immune system is severely weakened and cannot cope with infection.


THREE MODES OF TRANSMISSION
1.	Unprotected Sex
	✓	HIV can be transmitted Sexually through:

Conditions and Compliance
In order to receive the above-mentioned subsidies, all the succeeding conditions must be met by the household-beneficiaries:
1.	Pregnant women must avail pre- and post-natal care, and be attended during childbirth by a trained professional;
2.	Parents or guardians must attend the family development sessions, which include topics on responsible parenting, health, and nutrition;
3.	Children aged 0-5 must receive regular preventive health check-ups and vaccines;
4.	Children aged 6-14 must receive deworming pills twice a year; and
5.	Children-beneficiaries aged 3-18 must enroll in school, and maintain an attendance of at least 85% of class days every month.

How long will beneficiaries receive program benefits?
A household may continue to receive program benefits until the youngest of their children monitored for education graduates from high school or turns 19 years old before the start of the school year.
DSWD wants to see Pantawid Pamilya households eventually exit not only from the program but from poverty. The Pantawid Pamilya is linked up with other government programs like PhilHealth (for health insurance), UNIFAST (for college education), and Sustainable Livelihood Program (for employment and livelihood) to ensure that they are being helped while they are still in Pantawid Pamilya and that they have access to major social services when they have already exited the program.

How to Claim Unclaimed Refund?,Philhealth Unclaimed Refund,information2,putiancuarterocam19@gmail.com,"What is unclaimed refund?

•	An unclaimed refund is a benefit payment that must be reimbursed by the accredited hospital to the member for a specific confinement period. The refund results from either an under-deduction or non-availment of benefits at point-of-service due to various circumstances at the time of hospitalization, and these have remained unclaimed by the members for some time now. The unclaimed refunds have been retrieved by PhilHealth from the accredited hospitals for immediate return to the concerned members.

Who are entitled to the refund?

•	Not all members have a refund. Similarly, not all HCIs have refundable amounts to members. Only those members with which HCIs have declared unclaimed refunds are entitled to it.

How to claim?

•	If your name is in the list, proceed to the nearest PhilHealth office and present at least two (2) valid government-issued identification cards.

How will I know if I have Unclaimed Refund?

•	Access www.philhealth.gov.ph/unclaimedrefunds. Click the tab showing the list of members’ and patients’ names. If your name is not on the list but you think you might have a refund from a previous hospitalization, kindly check with the HCI where you were admitted to.

If the member is not available, who may claim the refund?
•	If the member is not available for reasons such as overseas worker, disability, etc., a representative may file the claim in his/her behalf. The claimant must bring the following documents:
•	Photocopy of valid ID card/passport of member
b. valid ID card of representative
c. authorization letter duly signed by the member

CLEFT REGISTRY
The social stigma associated with cleft conditions makes it difficult to identify patients and connect them to appropriate care.
The objective of Cleft Registry initiative is to improve decision-making in the selection of medical mission sites and increase understanding for policy making around cleft care. This is done by sourcing data about patients with untreated clefts from users of the Operation Smile mobile app and leveraging that data to visualize cleft prevalence in real-time.
Through mobile technology and community-based partnerships, the Cleft Registry initiative can help catalyse new tactics and strategic support in a way that systematically combats the backlog of untreated clefts in the Philippines.
How to Get Help
